<p class="calibre1">which comes from an old Tibetan text called  <i class="calibre3">The</i> <i class="calibre3">Root Text of the Seven Points of Training the Mind, </i> by Chekawa Yeshe Dorje. (See appendix.)</p>
<p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre3">Lojong </i> means “mind training.” The lojong teachings are organized around seven points that contain fifty-nine pithy slogans that remind us how to awaken our hearts.* Working with the slogans constitutes the heart of this book. These teachings belong to the mahayana school of Buddhism, which emphasizes compassionate communication and compassionate relationship with others. They also emphasize that we are not as solid as we think. In truth, there is enormous space in which to live our everyday lives. They help us see that the sense of a separate, isolated self and a separate, isolated other is a painful misunder-standing that we could see through and let go.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre3">Tonglen </i> means “taking in and sending out.” This meditation practice is designed to help ordinary people like ourselves connect with the openness and softness of our hearts. Instead of shielding and protecting our soft spot, with tonglen we could let ourselves feel what it is to be human. By so doing, we could widen our circle of compassion. Through this book I hope others may find such encouragement.</p>
<p class="calibre1">When I first read the lojong teachings I was struck by their unusual message that we can use our difficulties and problems to awaken our hearts. Rather</p>

<p class="calibre1">than seeing the unwanted aspects of life as obstacles, Jamgön Kongtrül presented them as the raw material necessary for awakening genuine uncontrived compassion: we can start where we are. Whereas in Kongtrül’s commentary the emphasis is primarily on taking on the suffering of others, it is apparent that in this present age it is necessary to also emphasize that the first step is to develop compassion for our own wounds. This book stresses repeatedly that it is unconditional compassion for ourselves that leads naturally to unconditional compassion for others. If we are willing to stand fully in our own shoes and never give up on ourselves, then we will be able to put ourselves in the shoes of others and never give up on them. True compassion does not come from wanting to help out those less fortunate than ourselves but from realizing our kinship with all beings.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Later I heard these instructions presented in a more contemporary mode by my own teacher, Chö-</p>
<p class="calibre1">gyam Trungpa, Rinpoche. (These have now been published in the book  <i class="calibre3">Training the Mind and Cultivating Loving-Kindness. </i>) Trungpa Rinpoche pointed out that he had first been given these teachings when he was quite young and that it was a great relief to him to find that Buddhism could be so practical and so helpful in everyday life. He was inspired to find that we could bring everything we encounter to the path and use it to awaken our intelligence, our compassion, and our ability to take a fresh look.</p>
