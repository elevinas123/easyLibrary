  <body class="calibre">
<p class="calibre1">yourself. Dharma isn’t philosophy. Dharma is basically a good recipe for how to cook yourself, how to soften the hardest, toughest piece of meat. Dharma is good instruction on how to stop cheating yourself, how to stop robbing yourself, how to find out who you really are, not in the limited sense of “I need” and</p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m gonna get,” but through developing wakefulness as your habit, your way of perceiving everything.</p>
<p class="calibre1">We talk about enlightenment as if it’s a big accom-plishment. Basically, it has to do with relaxing and finding out what you already have. The enlightened</p>
<p class="calibre1">“you” might be a slightly different “you” from the one you’re familiar with, but it still has hair growing out of its head, still has taste buds, and when it gets the flu, snot comes out of its nose. Enlightened, however, you might experience yourself in a slightly less claus-trophobic way, maybe a completely nonclaustropho-bic way.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Familiarization means that you don’t have to search any further, and you know it. It’s all in the</p>
<p class="calibre1">“pleasantness of the presentness,” in the very discursive thoughts you’re having now, in all the emotions that are coursing through you; it’s all in there somehow.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre3">Seed of virtue</i>. The third strength is called the seed of virtue. In effect, this is buddha nature or basic goodness. It’s like a swimming pool with no sides that you’re swimming in forever. In fact, you’re made out</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p138"></a>120</p>
<p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre3">Teachings for Life and Death</i></p>
<p class="calibre1">of water. Buddha nature isn’t like a heart transplant that you get from elsewhere. “It isn’t as if you’re trying to teach a tree to talk,” as Rinpoche once said. It’s just something that can be awakened or, you might say, relaxed into. Let yourself fall apart into wakefulness. The strength comes from the fact that the seed is already there; with warmth and moisture it sprouts and becomes visible above the ground. You find yourself looking like a daffodil, or feeling like one, anyway.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The practice is about softening or relaxing, but it’s also about precision and seeing clearly. None of that implies searching. Searching for happiness prevents us from ever finding it.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre3">Reproach</i>. The fourth strength is called reproach.</p>
<p class="calibre1">This one requires talking to yourself: “Ego, you’ve done nothing but cause me problems for ages. Give me a break. I’m not buying it anymore.” Try it in the shower. You should talk to yourself all the time without embarrassment. When you see yourself starting to spin off in frivolity, say to yourself, “Begone, you troublemaker!”</p>
<p class="calibre1">This approach can be slightly problematic because we don’t usually distinguish between who we think we are and our ego. The more gentleness that comes up, the more friendliness you feel for yourself, the more this dialogue is fruitful. But to the degree that you actually are hard on yourself, then this dialogue could just increase your self-criticism.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p139"></a> <i class="calibre3">Teachings for Life and Death</i> 121</p>
<p class="calibre1">Over the years, with encouragement from wonderful teachers, I have found that, rather than blaming yourself or yelling at yourself, you can teach the dharma to yourself. Reproach doesn’t have to be a negative reaction to your personal brand of insanity.</p>
<p class="calibre1">But it does imply that you see insanity as insanity, neurosis as neurosis, spinning off as spinning off. At that point, you can teach the dharma to yourself.</p>
<p class="calibre1">This advice was given to me by Thrangu Rinpoche.</p>
<p class="calibre1">I was having anxiety attacks, and he said that I should teach the dharma to myself, just good simple dharma. So now I say, “Pema, what do you really want? Do you want to shut down and close off, do you want to stay imprisoned? Or do you want to let yourself relax here, let yourself die? Here’s your chance to actually realize something. Here’s your chance not to be stuck. So what do you really want?</p>
<p class="calibre1">Do you want always to be right or do you want to wake up?”</p>
<p class="calibre1">Reproach can be very powerful. You yourself teach yourself the dharma in your own words. You can teach yourself the four noble truths, you can teach yourself about taking refuge— <i class="calibre3">anything </i> that has to do with that moment when you’re just about to re-create samsara as if you personally had invented it. Look ahead to the rest of your life and ask yourself what you want it to add up to.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Each time you’re willing to see your thoughts as empty, let them go, and come back to your breath,</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p140"></a>122</p>
<p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre3">Teachings for Life and Death</i></p>
<p class="calibre1">you’re sowing seeds of wakefulness, seeds of being able to see the nature of mind, and seeds of being able to rest in unconditional space. It doesn’t matter that you can’t do it every time. Just the willingness, the strong determination to do it, is sowing the seeds of virtue. You find that you can do it more spontaneously and naturally, without its being an effort. It begins with some sense of exertion and becomes your normal state. That’s the seed of bodhichitta ripening.</p>
<p class="calibre1">You find out who you really are.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre3">Aspiration</i>. The last strength, aspiration, is also a powerful tool. A heartfelt sense of aspiring cuts through negativity about yourself; it cuts through the heavy trips you lay on yourself. The notion of aspiration is simply that you voice your wishes for enlightenment. You say to yourself, for yourself, about yourself, and by yourself things like, “May my compassion for myself increase.” You might be feeling completely hopeless, down on yourself, and you can voice your heartfelt aspiration: “May my sense of being obstructed decrease. May my experience of wakefulness increase. May I experience my fundamental wisdom. May I think of others before myself.”</p>
<p class="calibre1">Aspiration is much like prayer, except that there’s nobody who hears you.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Aspiration, yet again, is to talk to yourself, to be an eccentric bodhisattva. It is a way to empower yourself. In fact, all five of these strengths are ways to em-</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p141"></a> <i class="calibre3">Teachings for Life and Death</i> 123</p>
<p class="calibre1">power yourself. Buddhism itself is all about empowering yourself, not about getting what you want.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The five strengths are the heart instructions on how to live and how to die. Whether it’s right now or at the moment of your death, they tell you how to wake up to whatever is going on.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p142"></a>1 4</p>
<p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre3">Loving-Kindness and</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre3">Compassion</i></p>
<p class="calibre1">All dharma agreesat one point. All the teachings and all the practices are about just one thing: if the way that we protect ourselves is strong, then suffering is really strong too. If the ego or the cocoon starts getting lighter, then suffering is lighter as well. Ego is like a really fat person trying to get through a very narrow door. If there’s lots of ego, then we’re always getting squeezed and poked and irritated by everything that comes along. When something comes along that doesn’t squeeze and poke and irritate us, we grasp it for dear life and want it to last forever. Then we suffer more as a result of holding on to ourselves.</p>
<p class="calibre1">One might think that we’re talking about ego as enemy, about ego as original sin. But this is a very different approach, a much softer approach. Rather than original  <i class="calibre3">sin, </i> there’s original  <i class="calibre3">soft spot. </i> The messy stuff that we see in ourselves and that we perceive in the world as violence and cruelty and fear is not the result of some basic badness but of the fact that we have such a tender, vulnerable, warm heart of bodhi-124</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p143"></a> <i class="calibre3">Loving-Kindness and Compassion</i> 125</p>
<p class="calibre1">chitta, which we instinctively protect so that nothing will touch it.</p>
<p class="calibre1">This is a life-affirming view; it starts from the point of basic goodness or basic good heart. The problem is that we continually grab the wrong end of the stick.</p>
<p class="calibre1">All practice agrees that there’s some fundamental pattern that we have in which we’re always trying to avoid the unpleasantness and grasp the pleasantness.</p>
<p class="calibre1">There seems to be a need to change the fundamental pattern of always protecting against anything touching our soft spot. Tonglen practice is about changing the basic pattern.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Earlier, I referred to ego as being a room where you just tried to get everything on your own terms. To get out of that room, you don’t drive up in a big machine and smash the whole thing to pieces. Rather, at your own speed, starting where you are, you begin to open the door and the windows. It’s a very gentle approach, one that acknowledges that you  <i class="calibre3">can </i> gradually begin to open that door. You can also shut it as often as you need to—not with the desire to stay comfortable but with the intention ultimately to gather more courage, more sense of humor, more basic curiosity about how to open that door, until you just leave it open and invite all sentient beings as your guests, until you feel at home with no agenda and with groundlessness.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The main thing about this practice and about all practice—all dharmas agree at one point—is that</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p144"></a>126</p>
<p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre3">Loving-Kindness and Compassion</i></p>
<p class="calibre1">you’re the only one who knows what is opening and what is closing down; you’re the only one who knows.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The next slogan, “Of the two witnesses, hold the principal one,” is saying that one witness is everybody else giving you their feedback and opinions (which is worth listening to; there’s some truth in what people say), but the principal witness is yourself. You’re the only one who knows when you’re opening and when you’re closing. You’re the only one who knows when you’re using things to protect yourself and keep your ego together and when you’re opening and letting things fall apart, letting the world come as it is—</p>
<p class="calibre1">working with it rather than struggling against it.</p>
<p class="calibre1">You’re the only one who knows.</p>
<p class="calibre1">There’s a later slogan that says, “Don’t make gods into demons.” What it means is that you can take something good—tonglen practice and the lojong teachings, for example (that’s the idea of “gods”)—</p>
<p class="calibre1">and turn it into a demon. You can just use anything to close your windows and doors.</p>
<p class="calibre1">You could do tonglen as one of my students once described to me. He said, “I do it, but I am very careful about the control button; I breathe in just enough so that it doesn’t really hurt or penetrate, and I breathe out just enough to convince myself, you know, that I’m doing the practice. But basically, nothing ever changes.” He was using tonglen just to smooth everything out and feel good. You can also use tonglen to feel like a hero: you’re just breathing</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p145"></a> <i class="calibre3">Loving-Kindness and Compassion</i> 127</p>
<p class="calibre1">in and out all over the place but your motivation isn’t to befriend and begin to penetrate those areas of yourself that you fear or reject. In fact, you hope the practice will just bolster your sense of confidence, bolster your sense of being in the right place at the right time, having chosen the right religion, and “I’m on the side of the good and all’s right with the world.” That doesn’t help much. Maybe you’ve noticed that sometimes you feel like you’re in a battle with reality and reality is always winning.</p>
<p class="calibre1">All of the teachings, and particularly the lojong teachings, are encouraging us, if we find ourselves struggling, to let that be a moment where we pause and wonder and begin to breathe in, trying to feel what’s underneath the struggle. If we find ourselves complaining, it isn’t that we have to say, “Oh, I’m bad because I’m struggling.” It’s not that it’s a sin to complain. We’re simply saying that the way to change the pattern is to begin to breathe in and connect with the heart, the soft spot that’s under all that protecting.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Karma is a difficult subject, but one of the reasons you are encouraged to work with what happens to you rather than blame it on others is that what happens is somehow a karmic result of things that you have done before. This kind of teaching on karma can easily be misunderstood. People get into a heavy-duty sin and guilt trip, feeling that if things are going wrong, that means they did something bad and they’re being punished. That’s not the idea at all. The</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p146"></a>128</p>
<p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre3">Loving-Kindness and Compassion</i></p>
<p class="calibre1">idea of karma is that you continually get the teachings that you need in order to open your heart. To the degree that you didn’t understand in the past how to stop protecting your soft spot, how to stop armoring your heart, you’re given this gift of teachings in the form of your life, to give you everything you need to learn how to open further.</p>
<p class="calibre1">I saw a cartoon that describes this. A head of iceberg lettuce is sitting in a garden saying, “Oh, no, how did I get in this vegetable garden again? I wanted to be a wildflower!” The caption reads, “Oscar is born again as a head of iceberg lettuce in order to overcome his fear of being eaten.” One can think from a bigger perspective than this whole notion of reward and punishment. You could see your life as an adult education course. Some of the curriculum you like and some you don’t like; some of what comes up you find workable, some you don’t. That’s the curriculum for attaining enlightenment. The question is, how do you work with it?</p>
<p class="calibre1">When you begin to touch your heart or let your heart be touched, you begin to discover that it’s bot-tomless, that it doesn’t have any resolution, that this heart is huge, vast, and limitless. You begin to discover how much warmth and gentleness is there, as well as how much space. Your world seems less solid, more roomy and spacious. The burden lightens. In the beginning it might feel like sadness or a shaky feeling, accompanied by a lot of fear, but your will-</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p147"></a> <i class="calibre3">Loving-Kindness and Compassion</i> 129</p>
<p class="calibre1">ingness to feel the fear, to make fear your companion, is growing. You’re willing to get to know yourself at this deep level. After awhile this same feeling begins to turn into a longing to raze all the walls, a longing to be fully human and to live in your world without always having to shut down and close off when certain things come along. It begins to turn into a longing to be there for your friends when they’re in trouble, to be of real help to this poor, aching planet. Curiously enough, along with this longing and this sadness and this tenderness, there’s an immense sense of well-being, unconditional well-being, which doesn’t have anything to do with pleasant or unpleasant, good or bad, hope or fear, disgrace or fame. It’s something that simply comes to you when you feel that you can keep your heart open.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p148"></a>1 5</p>
<p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre3">Lighten Up</i></p>
<p class="calibre1">The next two slogans—”Always maintain</p>
<p class="calibre1">only a joyful mind” and “If you can practice even when distracted, you are well trained”—go hand in hand. The first is saying that if you regard everything that arises as fuel to wake up, you can remain cheerful. The second is saying that you are well trained if you  <i class="calibre3">can </i> do that—use everything in your life to wake yourself up rather than put yourself to sleep—no matter what.</p>
<p class="calibre1">If you feel completely caught up and are spinning off into a misery scenario, the slogan “If you can practice even when distracted, you are well trained” can remind you to start to work with tonglen—to breathe in the mishap or the misery as a way of developing compassion for yourself and as a way of beginning to understand other people’s pain as well. You can use the distraction to bring yourself back to the present moment, just as a horse rights itself after losing bal-ance or skiers catch themselves just as they are about to fall. Being well trained means you can catch yourself and come back to the present.</p>
<p class="calibre1">When things are going well, that can also be a re-130</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p149"></a> <i class="calibre3">Lighten Up</i></p>
<p class="calibre1">131</p>
<p class="calibre1">minder. Instead of habitually clinging to what’s delightful, you could become accustomed to giving it away, sending it out to others on the outbreath. This enables you always to maintain a joyful mind. It begins to ease away the burden of maintaining your own private happiness as well as your usual load of unhappy situations and minor irritations—the burden of ego.</p>
<p class="calibre1">On the other hand, sending out the joyful stuff is also difficult to do. As someone said, “I like doing the outbreath with this idea of sharing. Sharing is really nice, but giving it away? That means I wouldn’t have it anymore.” The outbreath and sharing what’s pleasant can be threatening. You don’t often feel willing to share or give away that pleasure.</p>
<p class="calibre1">There’s a lot of joy as your burden begins to lessen, and it comes from doing anything that begins to change the pattern of fearing and wanting to resist what’s unpleasant. Resistance is really what causes the pain; more than the anger itself, or the jealousy itself, it’s resistance that causes the pain. Anything that begins to lighten up that resistance helps us to relax and open and celebrate.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Sooner or later you will find yourself in a situation where you can’t change the outer circumstances at all, and you realize it all comes down to how you relate to things—whether you continue to struggle against everything that’s coming at you or you begin</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p150"></a>132</p>
<p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre3">Lighten Up</i></p>
<p class="calibre1">to work with things. “Always maintain only a joyful mind” can be very helpful to remember in such a situation.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Anything that helps us not to be so desperate about pleasure and not to fear its transitory nature is also introducing us to being at home in our world and being able to help other people. In popular songs you hear lines like “Freedom’s just another word for nothing left to lose” or “I’ve got plenty of nothing and nothing’s plenty for me.” “Great bliss arising from the experience of emptiness” is how it’s described in traditional Tibetan texts, which sounds somewhat remote from personal experience. However, all these words are saying the same thing: we practice and we live in order to be able to relax and lighten up and not make such a big deal about everything that happens—the successes and the failures, the rewards and the punishments.</p>
<p class="calibre1">If your principal witness (in “Of the two witnesses, hold the principal one”) is a judgmental authority figure, it might be hard to lighten up. Let’s say you’re meditating, but there’s this other “you” standing behind with a stick, saying, “You’re thinking again, you’re always thinking! Whack! There goes the tonglen bell and you didn’t practice tonglen for even a second! Smack!” You say to yourself, “I can’t do this.</p>
<p class="calibre1">I’m hopeless. Everybody else seems to be doing fine, but I don’t seem to have any basic goodness.” Then you beat yourself up and forget all about gentleness,</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p151"></a> <i class="calibre3">Lighten Up</i></p>
<p class="calibre1">133</p>
<p class="calibre1">or if you remember, you say, “You’re not gentle!</p>
<p class="calibre1">Whack!”</p>
<p class="calibre1">You hear a slogan like “Always maintain only a joyful mind,” and for the whole next two weeks you’re just hitting yourself over the head for never being joyful. That kind of witness is a bit heavy. So lighten up.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Don’t make such a big deal. The key to feeling at home with your body, mind, and emotions, to feeling worthy to live on this planet, comes from being able to lighten up. This earnestness, this seriousness about everything in our lives—including practice—</p>
<p class="calibre1">this goal-oriented, we’re-going-to-do-it-or-else attitude, is the world’s greatest killjoy. There’s no sense of appreciation because we’re so solemn about everything. In contrast, a joyful mind is very ordinary and relaxed.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Once on retreat I was reading some traditional text that talked about bliss and special experiences, and I began to feel wretched. I felt poverty-stricken about never having had any experiences that felt like bliss, clarity, or luminosity. I began to feel depressed that I didn’t measure up to any of these glowing words. Fortunately, I put that book down and picked up something simple about just being alive with who you are right now—nothing special, no big deal, ordinary: just keep your eyes open, keep your ears open, stay awake. Those simple instructions began to cheer me up, because I felt that I could follow them.</p>
<p class="calibre1">When your aspiration is to lighten up, you begin to</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p152"></a>134</p>
<p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre3">Lighten Up</i></p>
<p class="calibre1">have a sense of humor. Things just keep popping your serious state of mind. In addition to a sense of humor, a basic support for a joyful mind is curiosity, paying attention, taking an interest in the world around you.</p>
<p class="calibre1">You don’t actually have to be happy. But being curious without a heavy judgmental attitude helps. If you <i class="calibre3">are </i> judgmental, you can even be curious about that.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Notice everything. Appreciate everything, including the ordinary. That’s how to click in with joyfulness or cheerfulness. Curiosity encourages cheering up.</p>
<p class="calibre1">So does simply remembering to do something different. We are so locked into this sense of burden—Big Deal Joy and Big Deal Unhappiness—that it’s sometimes helpful just to change the pattern. Anything out of the ordinary will help, and tonglen is definitely something different. This practice is about repatterning ourselves, changing the basic pattern and unpatterning ourselves together. You can also just go to the window and look at the sky. You can splash cold water on your face, you can sing in the shower, you can go jogging—anything that’s against your usual pattern.</p>
<p class="calibre1">That’s how things start to lighten up.</p>
<p class="calibre1">I just read a story about a woman who had been gloomy all her life. As she grew older, she got more irritable and difficult. Then she got cancer and for some peculiar reason—after an initial period of resistance and anger—instead of getting more gloomy, she began to cheer up. The more she fell apart, the happier she got. She kept saying she was glad that</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p153"></a> <i class="calibre3">Lighten Up</i></p>
<p class="calibre1">135</p>
<p class="calibre1">she had this time to enjoy her life, which she had not enjoyed up to the moment that she got sick. Finally, the day before she died, she went into a coma. Everybody in her family, who were coming to feel more and more fond of her after all those years of finding her to be a pain in the neck, gathered around her bed crying and looking gloomy, just as she used to look. Just before she died, she opened her eyes to see them all standing there, and she said, “Gosh, you all look so unhappy. Is something wrong?” She died laughing.</p>
<p class="calibre1">So, “Always maintain only a joyful mind” and “If you can practice even when distracted, you are well trained” are implying that the best gift you can give yourself is to lighten up. One way to do that is to let distraction bring you back to the present moment.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Another way is to be curious. In addition, when things are really heavy and you feel stuck in either your joy or your misery, just do something different to change the pattern. Tonglen is a good suggestion of what you could do.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p154"></a>1 6</p>
<p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre3">Abandon Any Hope </i></p>
<p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre3">of Fruition</i></p>
<p class="calibre1">Our next slogan is “Abandon any hope of</p>
<p class="calibre1">fruition.” You could also say, “Give up all hope”</p>
<p class="calibre1">or “Give up” or just “Give.” The shorter the better.</p>
<p class="calibre1">One of the most powerful teachings of the Buddhist tradition is that as long as you are wishing for things to change, they never will. As long as you’re wanting yourself to get better, you won’t. As long as you have an orientation toward the future, you can never just relax into what you already have or already are.</p>
<p class="calibre1">One of the deepest habitual patterns that we have is to feel that now is not good enough. We think back to the past a lot, which maybe was better than now, or perhaps worse. We also think ahead quite a bit to the future—which we may fear—always holding out hope that it might be a little bit better than now. Even if now is going really well—we have good health and we’ve met the person of our dreams, or we just had a child or got the job we wanted—nevertheless there’s a deep tendency always to think about how it’s going 136</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p155"></a> <i class="calibre3">Abandon Any Hope of Fruition</i> 137</p>
<p class="calibre1">to be later. We don’t quite give ourselves full credit for who we are in the present.</p>
<p class="calibre1">For example, it’s easy to hope that things will improve as a result of meditation, that we won’t have such bad tempers anymore or we won’t have fear anymore or people will like us more than they do now. Or maybe none of those things are problems for us, but we feel we aren’t spiritual enough. Surely we will connect with that awake, brilliant, sacred world that we are going to find through meditation. In everything we read—whether it’s philosophy or dharma books or psychology—there’s the implication that we’re caught in some kind of very small perspective and that if we just did the right things, we’d begin to connect with a bigger world, a vaster world, different from the one we’re in now.</p>
<p class="calibre1">One reason I wanted to talk about giving up all hope of fruition is because I’ve been meditating and giving dharma talks for some time now, but I find that I still have a secret passion for what it’s going to be like when—as they say in some of the classical texts—”all the veils have been removed.” It’s that same feeling of wanting to jump over yourself and find something that’s more awake than the present situation, more alert than the present situation.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Sometimes this occurs at a very mundane level: you want to be thinner, have less acne or more hair. But somehow there’s almost always a subtle or not so sub-</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p156"></a>138</p>
<p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre3">Abandon Any Hope of Fruition</i></p>
<p class="calibre1">tle sense of disappointment, a sense of things not completely measuring up.</p>
<p class="calibre1">In one of the first teachings I ever heard, the teacher said, “I don’t know why you came here, but I want to tell you right now that the basis of this whole teaching is that you’re never going to get everything together.” I felt a little like he had just slapped me in the face or thrown cold water over my head. But I’ve always remembered it. He said, “You’re never going to get it all together.” There isn’t going to be some precious future time when all the loose ends will be tied up. Even though it was shocking to me, it rang true.</p>
<p class="calibre1">One of the things that keeps us unhappy is this continual searching for pleasure or security, searching for a little more comfortable situation, either at the domestic level or at the spiritual level or at the level of mental peace.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Nowadays, people go to a lot of different places trying to find what they’re looking for. There are 12-step programs; someone told me that there is now a 24-step program; someday there will probably be a 108-step program. There are a lot of support groups and different therapies. Many people feel wounded and are looking for something to heal them. To me it seems that at the root of healing, at the root of feeling like a fully adult person, is the premise that you’re not going to try to make anything go away, that what you have is worth appreciating. But this is hard to swal-low if what you have is pain.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p157"></a> <i class="calibre3">Abandon Any Hope of Fruition</i> 139</p>
<p class="calibre1">In Boston there’s a stress-reduction clinic run on Buddhist principles. It was started by Dr. Jon Kabat-Zinn, a Buddhist practitioner and author of  <i class="calibre3">Full Catastrophe Living. </i> He says that the basic premise of his clinic—to which many people come with a lot of pain—is to give up any hope of fruition. Otherwise the treatment won’t work. If there’s some sense of wanting to change yourself, then it comes from a place of feeling that you’re not good enough. It comes from aggression toward yourself, dislike of your present mind, speech, or body; there’s something about yourself that you feel is not good enough. People come to the clinic with addictions, abuse issues, or stress from work—with all kinds of issues. Yet this simple ingredient of giving up hope is the most important ingredient for developing sanity and healing.</p>
<p class="calibre1">That’s the main thing. As long as you’re wanting to be thinner, smarter, more enlightened, less uptight, or whatever it might be, somehow you’re always going to be approaching your problem with the very same logic that created it to begin with: you’re not good enough. That’s why the habitual pattern never un-winds itself when you’re trying to improve, because you go about it in exactly the same habitual style that caused all the pain to start.</p>
<p class="calibre1">There’s a life-affirming teaching in Buddhism, which is that Buddha, which means “awake,” is not someone you worship. Buddha is not someone you aspire to; Buddha is not somebody who was born</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p158"></a>140</p>
<p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre3">Abandon Any Hope of Fruition</i></p>
<p class="calibre1">more than two thousand years ago and was smarter than you’ll ever be. Buddha is our inherent nature—</p>
<p class="calibre1">our buddha nature—and what that means is that if you’re going to grow up fully, the way that it happens is that you begin to connect with the intelligence that you already have. It’s not like some intelligence that’s going to be transplanted into you. If you’re going to be fully mature, you will no longer be imprisoned in the childhood feeling that you always need to protect yourself or shield yourself because things are too harsh. If you’re going to be a grown-up—which I would define as being completely at home in your world no matter how difficult the situation—it’s because you will allow something that’s already in you to be nurtured. You allow it to grow, you allow it to come out, instead of all the time shielding it and protecting it and keeping it buried.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Someone once told me, “When you feel afraid, that’s ‘fearful buddha.’” That could be applied to whatever you feel. Maybe anger is your thing. You just go out of control and you see red, and the next thing you know you’re yelling or throwing something or hitting someone. At that time, begin to accept the fact that that’s “enraged buddha.” If you feel jealous, that’s “jealous buddha.” If you have indigestion, that’s</p>
<p class="calibre1">“buddha with heartburn.” If you’re happy, “happy buddha”; if bored, “bored buddha.” In other words, anything that you can experience or think is worthy</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p159"></a> <i class="calibre3">Abandon Any Hope of Fruition</i> 141</p>
<p class="calibre1">of compassion; anything you could think or feel is worthy of appreciation.</p>
<p class="calibre1">This teaching was powerful for me; it stuck. I would find myself in various states of mind and various moods, going up and down, going left and right, falling on my face and sitting up—just in all these different life situations—and I would remember, “Buddha falling flat on her face; buddha feeling on top of the world; buddha longing for yesterday.” I began to learn that I couldn’t get away from buddha no matter how hard I tried. I could stick with myself through thick and thin. If one would enter into an unconditional relationship with oneself, one would be entering into an unconditional relationship with buddha.</p>
<p class="calibre1">This is why the slogan says, “Abandon any hope of fruition.” “Fruition” implies that at a future time you will feel good. There is another word, which is <i class="calibre3">open</i>—to have an open heart and open mind. This is oriented very much to the present. If you enter into an unconditional relationship with yourself, that means sticking with the buddha right now on the spot as you find yourself.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Because it’s a monastery, there’s nothing you can do at Gampo Abbey that’s fun, unless you like to meditate all the time or take walks in nature, but everything gets boring after awhile. There’s no sex there, you can’t drink there, you also can’t lie. Occasionally we’ll see a video, but that’s rare and usually</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p160"></a>142</p>
<p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre3">Abandon Any Hope of Fruition</i></p>
<p class="calibre1">there’s a dispute about what it’s going to be. The food is sometimes good and sometimes terrible; it’s just a very uncomfortable place. The reason it’s uncomfortable is that you can’t get away from yourself there.</p>
<p class="calibre1">However, the more people make friends with themselves, the more they find it a nurturing and supportive place where you can find out the buddhaness of your own self as you are right now, today. Right now today, could you make an unconditional relationship with yourself? Just at the height you are, the weight you are, the amount of intelligence that you have, the burden of pain that you have? Could you enter into an unconditional relationship with that?</p>
<p class="calibre1">Giving up any hope of fruition has something in common with the title of my previous book,  <i class="calibre3">The Wisdom of No Escape. </i>“No escape” leaves you continually right in the present, and the present is whatever it is, whatever mood you happen to be in, whatever thoughts you happen to be having. That’s it.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Whether you get meditation instruction from the Theravada tradition or the Zen tradition or the Vajra-yana tradition, the basic instruction is always about being awake in the present moment. What they don’t tell you is that the present moment can be you, this you about whom you sometimes don’t feel very good.</p>
<p class="calibre1">That’s what there is to wake up to.</p>
<p class="calibre1">When one of the emperors of China asked Bod-hidharma (the Zen master who brought Zen from India to China) what enlightenment was, his answer</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p161"></a> <i class="calibre3">Abandon Any Hope of Fruition</i> 143</p>
<p class="calibre1">was, “Lots of space, nothing holy.” Meditation is nothing holy. Therefore there’s nothing that you think or feel that somehow gets put in the category of</p>
<p class="calibre1">“sin.” There’s nothing that you can think or feel that gets put in the category of “bad.” There’s nothing that you can think or feel that gets put in the category of</p>
<p class="calibre1">“wrong.” It’s all good juicy stuff—the manure of waking up, the manure of achieving enlightenment, the art of living in the present moment.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p162"></a>1 7</p>
<p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre3">Compassionate Action</i></p>
<p class="calibre1">How do we help? How do we create a saner</p>
<p class="calibre1">world or a saner domestic situation or job situation, wherever we may be? How do we work with our actions and our speech and our minds in a way that opens up the space rather than closes it down?</p>
<p class="calibre1">In other words, how do we create space for other people and ourselves to connect with our own wisdom? How do we create a space where we can find out how to become more a part of this world we are living in and less separate and isolated and afraid?</p>
<p class="calibre1">How do we do that?</p>
<p class="calibre1">It all starts with loving-kindness for oneself, which in turn becomes loving-kindness for others. As the barriers come down around our own hearts, we are less afraid of other people. We are more able to hear what is being said, see what is in front of our eyes, and work in accord with what happens rather than struggle against it. The lojong teachings say that the way to help, the way to act compassionately, is to exchange oneself for other. When you can put yourself in someone else’s shoes, then you know what is needed, and what would speak to the heart.</p>
<p class="calibre1">I recently received a letter from a friend in which 144</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p163"></a> <i class="calibre3">Compassionate Action</i></p>
<p class="calibre1">145</p>
<p class="calibre1">she dumped all over me and told me off. My first reaction was to be hurt and my second reaction was to get mad, and then I began to compose this letter in my mind, this very dharmic letter that I was going to write back to her using all the teachings and all the lojong logic to tell her off. Because of the style of our relationship, she would have been intimidated by a dharmic letter, but it wouldn’t have helped anything.</p>
<p class="calibre1">It would have further forced us into these roles of being two separate people, each of us believing in our roles more and more seriously, that I was the one who knew it all and she was the poor student. But on that day when I had spent so much energy composing this letter, just by a turn of circumstance, something happened to me that caused me to feel tremendous loneliness. I felt sad and vulnerable. In that state of mind, I suddenly knew where my friend’s letter had come from—loneliness and feeling left out. It was her attempt to communicate.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Sometimes when you’re feeling miserable, you challenge people to see if they will still like you when you show them how ugly you can get. Because of how I myself was feeling I knew that what she needed was not for somebody to dump back on her. So I wrote a very different letter from what I had planned, an extremely honest one that said, “You know, you can dump on me all you like and put all of your stuff out there, but I’m not going to give up on you.” It wasn’t a wishy-washy letter that avoided the issue that there</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p164"></a>146</p>
<p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre3">Compassionate Action</i></p>
<p class="calibre1">had been a confrontation and that I had been hurt by it. On the other hand, it wasn’t a letter in which I went to the other extreme and lashed out. For the first time, I felt I had experienced what it meant to exchange oneself for other. When you’ve been there you know what it feels like, and therefore you can give something that you know will open up the space and cause things to keep flowing. You can give something that will help someone else connect with their own insight and courage and gentleness, rather than further polarize the situation.</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Drive all blames into one” is a pivotal slogan because usually driving blames into  <i class="calibre3">other </i> comes from the fact that we’ve been hurt and therefore want to hurt back. It’s that kind of logic. Therefore the exchange—putting ourselves in someone else’s shoes—doesn’t come from theory, in which you try to imagine what someone else is feeling. It comes from becoming so familiar and so openhearted and so honest about who you are and what you do that you begin to understand humanness altogether and you can speak appropriately to the situation.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The basic ground of compassionate action is the importance of working  <i class="calibre3">with </i> rather than struggling <i class="calibre3">against, </i> and what I mean by that is working with your own unwanted, unacceptable stuff, so that when the unacceptable and unwanted appears out  <i class="calibre3">there, </i> you relate to it based on having worked with loving-kindness for yourself. Then there is no condescension.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p165"></a> <i class="calibre3">Compassionate Action</i></p>
<p class="calibre1">147</p>
<p class="calibre1">This nondualistic approach is true to the heart because it’s based on our kinship with each other. We know what to say, because we have experienced closing down, shutting off, being angry, hurt, rebellious, and so forth, and have made a relationship with those things in ourselves.</p>
<p class="calibre1">This is not about problem resolution. This is a more open-ended and courageous approach. It has to do with not knowing what will happen. It has nothing to do with wanting to get ground under your feet. It’s about keeping your heart and your mind open to whatever arises, without hope of fruition. Problem solving is based first on thinking there is a problem and second on thinking there is a solution. The concepts of problem and solution can keep us stuck in thinking that there is an enemy and a saint or a right way and a wrong way. The approach we’re suggesting is more groundless than that.</p>
<p class="calibre1">A key slogan is “Change your attitude, but remain natural” or “Change your attitude and relax as it is.”</p>
<p class="calibre1">In order to have compassionate relationships, compassionate communication, and compassionate social action, there has to be a fundamental change of attitude. The notion “I am the helper and you are the one who needs help” might work in a temporary way, but fundamentally nothing changes, because there’s still one who has it and one who doesn’t. That dualistic notion is not really speaking to the heart.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p166"></a>148</p>
<p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre3">Compassionate Action</i></p>
<p class="calibre1">As expressed in the lojong teachings, that fundamental change of attitude is to breathe the undesirable in and breathe the desirable out. In contrast, the attitude that is epidemic on the planet is that if it’s unpleasant we push it away and if it’s pleasant we hold tight and grasp it.</p>
<p class="calibre1">This change in attitude doesn’t happen overnight; it happens gradually, at our own speed. If we have the aspiration to stop resisting those parts of ourselves that we find unacceptable and instead begin to breathe them in, this gives us much more space.</p>
<p class="calibre1">We come to know every part of ourselves, with no more monsters in the closet, no more demons in the cave. We have some sense of turning on the lights and looking at ourselves honestly and with great compassion.</p>
<p class="calibre1">We could begin to get the hang of changing our attitude on an everyday level: when things are delightful and wonderful we give our pleasure away on the outbreath, sharing it with others. That also allows for enormous space—not just for us, but for everyone.</p>
<p class="calibre1">When we do this, all of our inner obstacles that keep us from connecting with our inherent freshness and openness begin to dissolve. This is the fundamental change of attitude—this working with pain and pleasure in a revolutionary and courageous way.</p>
<p class="calibre1">When we work with pain by leaning into it and with pleasure by giving it away, it doesn’t mean that</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p167"></a> <i class="calibre3">Compassionate Action</i></p>
<p class="calibre1">149</p>
<p class="calibre1">we “grin and bear it.” This approach is a lot more playful than that—like dancing with it. We realize that this separateness that we feel is a funny kind of mistake. We see that things were not dualistic from the start; we can wake up to that realization. The basis of any real kind of compassionate action is the insight that the others who seem to be out there are some kind of mirror image of ourselves. By making friends with yourself, you make friends with others.</p>
<p class="calibre1">By hurting others, you hurt yourself.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Another slogan says, “Always abide by the three basic principles.” The first basic principle is always to abide by any vows you have taken—the refuge vows that you take to become a Buddhist and the bodhisattva vows taken later as an expression of your wish to benefit others. The second principle is to refrain from showing off, or from outrageous conduct. The third is always to cultivate patience. So these are the three basic principles: keeping the vows you have taken, refraining from outrageous conduct, and cultivating patience.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre3">Keeping the vows you have taken</i>. The first principle, to keep the vows you have taken, speaks specifically to those of us who have taken the refuge vows and bodhisattva vows, but it may be helpful for everyone to hear a little bit about these vows. The refuge vow</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p168"></a>150</p>
<p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre3">Compassionate Action</i></p>
<p class="calibre1">is basically about making a commitment to become a refugee, which in essence means that rather than always trying to get security, you begin to develop an attitude of wanting to step into uncharted territory. It’s a vow that you take because you feel that the way to health and becoming a complete human being is to no longer hold so tightly to yourself. You long to go beyond that situation. You are no longer afraid of yourself. You can become a refugee because when you aren’t afraid of yourself, you don’t feel that you need a protected place to hide in.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The image of the bodhisattva vow could be, “Not afraid of others.” When you take the bodhisattva vow you open the windows and doors and invite all sentient beings as your guests. Having understood the futility and pain of always holding on to yourself, you want to take the next step and begin to work with others.</p>
<p class="calibre1">You might think that you are working with others because you are much more sane than they are and you want to spread that sanity. But a more profound insight is that you realize that the only way to go further is to open those doors and windows and not protect yourself any more but work with whatever arrives. That’s the only way to wake up further. The motivation for making friends with yourself becomes wanting to help others; these two work together. You know you can’t help others if you’re not making friends with yourself.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p169"></a> <i class="calibre3">Compassionate Action</i></p>
<p class="calibre1">151</p>
<p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre3"><i class="calibre3"> </i> *</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre3">Refraining from outrageous conduct</i>. The second basic principle is to refrain from outrageous conduct.</p>
<p class="calibre1">If you have this ideal of yourself as a hero or helper or doctor and everybody else as the victim, the patient, the deprived, the underdog, you are continuing to create the notion of separateness. Someone might end up getting more food or better housing, and that’s a big help; those things are necessary. But the fundamental problem of isolation, hatred, and aggression is not addressed. Or perhaps you get flamboyant in your helper role. You often see this with political action. People make a big display, and suddenly the whole thing doesn’t have to do with helping anyone at all but with building themselves up.</p>
<p class="calibre1">In the seventies there was a famous photograph in which the National Guard were all lined up with their guns at an antiwar rally. A young woman had walked up and put a flower in the end of one of the guns, and the photo appeared in all the newspapers.</p>
<p class="calibre1">I read a report in which the soldier who had been holding that gun—who later became a strong peace activist—said that he had never before experienced anything as aggressive as that young woman coming with her flower and smiling at everybody and making this big display. Most of those young guys in the National Guard were already questioning how they got on that particular side of the fence anyway. And then along came this flower child. She never looked</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p170"></a>152</p>
<p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre3">Compassionate Action</i></p>
<p class="calibre1">in his eyes; she never had any sense of him as a person. It was all for display, and it hurt. So that’s part of the point of this slogan. You have to question what’s behind your action, especially if it is making a big splash.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre3">Cultivating patience</i>. The last of the three basic principles is to cultivate patience, which is the same as cultivating nonaggression. Patience and nonaggression are basically encouragement to wait. Sometimes I think of tonglen that way. You are in a situation in which you would normally just yell back or throw something or think of the person you are with in the same old stuck way. Instead it occurs to you to begin to do the exchange for other. This whole solid sense of self and other begins to get addressed when you cultivate patience. You learn to pause, learn to wait, learn to listen, and learn to look, allowing yourself and others some space—just slowing down the camera instead of speeding it up.</p>
<p class="calibre1">It’s a little bit like the old advice to count to ten before you say something; it makes you pause. If you become afraid or angry, there is a natural kind of adrenalin principle, when the camera actually starts to speed up. The speeding up itself can bring you back to the present. You can use it as a reminder just to slow down and listen and look and wait and develop patience.
</p><p class="calibre1">
</p><p class="calibre5"><i class="calibre3"> </i> *</p>


<a id="p171"></a> <i class="calibre3">Compassionate Action</i><p class="calibre1"></p>
<p class="calibre1">153</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Abandon poisonous food” and “Don’t make gods into demons” are warnings that only you know whether what you are doing is good practice (“gods” or “good food”). Anything could be used to build yourself up and smooth things over and calm things down or to keep everything under control. Good food becomes poisonous food and gods become demons when you use them to keep yourself in that room with the doors and windows closed.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Another slogan that concerns compassionate action is “Work with the greatest defilements first.” Developing loving-kindness for yourself is the basis for compassionate communication and relationship.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The time is now, not later. The greatest defilement is what you consider to be the greatest obstacle. This slogan is suggesting that you start where you feel most stuck. Making friends with that will begin to automatically take care of the smaller obstacles.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Because the larger obstacles like rage or jealousy or terror are so dramatic, their vividness itself may be a reminder to work with the practice of tonglen. We may so take for granted the multitude of minor daily irritations that we don’t even think of them as something to work with. To some degree they are the hardest obstacles to work with because they don’t reveal themselves. The only way you know that these are arising is that you feel righteous indignation. Let righteous indignation be your guide that someone is</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p172"></a>154</p>
<p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre3">Compassionate Action</i></p>
<p class="calibre1">holding on to themselves, and that someone is probably you.</p>
<p class="calibre1">If you begin to work with the greater defilements, or the major stuck places, these little ones tend to become more obvious to you as well. Whereas if you try to work with all of these little ones, they are like your hands and your nose; you don’t even think of them as anything but you, and there is no sense of them as obstacle. You just buy them every time they happen.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Our greatest obstacles are also our greatest wisdom. In all the unwanted stuff there is something sharp and penetrating; there’s great wisdom there.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Suppose anger or rage is what we consider our greatest obstacle, or maybe it’s addiction and craving. This breeds all kinds of conflict and tension and stress, but at the same time it has a penetrating quality that cuts through all of the confusion and delusion. It’s both things at once.</p>
<p class="calibre1">When you realize that your greatest defilement is facing you and there seems no way to get out of it because it’s so big, the instruction is, let go of the story line, let go of the conversation, and own your feeling completely. Let the words go and return to the essential quality of the underlying stuff. That’s the notion of the inbreath, the notion of making friends with ourselves at a profound level. In the process we are making friends with all sentient beings, because that is what life is made of. Working with the greater defilements first is saying that now is the time, and also</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p173"></a> <i class="calibre3">Compassionate Action</i></p>
<p class="calibre1">155</p>
<p class="calibre1">that our greatest obstacles are our greatest wealth.</p>
<p class="calibre1">From the point of view of wanting to stay cozy and separate in your room, this work is extremely threatening. Part of the path of compassionate action is to begin to explore that notion of the inbreath and test it, to see if it rings true for you.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p174"></a>1 8</p>
<p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre3">Taking Responsibility </i></p>
<p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre3">for Your Own Actions</i></p>
<p class="calibre1">What really helpsanother person, anyway?</p>
<p class="calibre1">What really causes things to evolve in some kind of natural spontaneous way? The next slogans provide some direction. Each begins with the word <i class="calibre3">don’t</i>. I like to call them the “naked truth” slogans.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Taking responsibility for your own actions is another way of talking about awakening bodhichitta, because part of taking responsibility is the quality of being able to see things very clearly. Another part of taking responsibility is gentleness, which goes along with not judging, not calling things right or wrong, good or bad, but looking gently and honestly at yourself. Finally there is also the ability to keep going forward. It’s been described before as letting go, but in some sense at a personal level it’s that you can just keep on going; you don’t get completely overwhelmed by this identity as a loser or a winner, the abuser or the abused, the good guy or the bad guy. You just see what you do as clearly and as compassionately as you can and then go on. The next moment is always fresh 156</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p175"></a> <i class="calibre3">Taking Responsibility for Your Own Actions</i> 157</p>
<p class="calibre1">and open. You don’t have to get frozen in an identity of any kind.</p>
<p class="calibre1">A Gary Larson cartoon shows two Martians who are hiding behind a rock. They’ve set up a mirror on one side of the path in front of the rock, down which are walking a man and a woman. One Martian says to the other: “Let’s see if it attacks its own image.”</p>
<p class="calibre1">It seems that we do attack our own image continually, and usually that image appears to be be “out there.” We want to blame men or we want to blame women or we want to blame white people or black people, or we want to blame politicians or the police; we want to blame  <i class="calibre3">somebody. </i> There’s some tendency to always put it out there, even if “out there” is our own body. Instead of working  <i class="calibre3">with, </i> there is the tendency to struggle  <i class="calibre3">against. </i> As a result, we become alienated. Then we take the wrong medicine for our illness by armoring ourselves in all these different ways, somehow not getting back to the soft spot.</p>
<p class="calibre1">So today’s slogans present the great exposé. The first one is “Don’t talk about injured limbs.” In other words, don’t talk about other people’s defects. We all get the same kind of satisfaction when we are all sitting around the table discussing Mortimer’s bad breath. Not only that, he has dandruff, and not only that, he laughs funny; not only that, he’s stupid.</p>
<p class="calibre1">There is this peculiar security we get out of talking</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p176"></a>158</p>
<p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre3">Taking Responsibility for Your Own Actions</i> about other people’s defects. Sometimes we sugar-coat it and pretend that we’re not really doing it. We say something like, “Hi there. Did you know that Juanita steals?” Then we say, “Oh no, I shouldn’t have said that. Excuse me, that was really unkind for me to say that, and I won’t say any more.” We’d love to go on and on, but instead we say just enough to get people against Juanita but not enough for them to disapprove of us for slandering her.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Then there’s “Don’t ponder others.” It’s talking about putting down other people to build yourself up.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Maybe you only do it mentally. After all, you don’t actually say these things out loud, because people would disapprove, but in your mind you talk a lot about Mortimer: how you hate how he dresses and how he walks and how he stares coldly at you when you try to smile. You say, “Now this is enough. I’ve been criticizing Mortimer since the day I arrived here. I’m going to try to make friends,” but Mortimer just meets your sunny false smile with an icy stare. So you continue to ponder Mortimer’s awful ways as you sit here on the cushion, and you very seldom label it</p>
<p class="calibre1">“thinking” or breathe it in. It doesn’t occur to you to exchange yourself for Mortimer, and you certainly don’t feel grateful to him.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The next is “Don’t be so predictable,” which has also been translated as, “Don’t be so trustworthy.” It’s an</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p177"></a> <i class="calibre3">Taking Responsibility for Your Own Actions</i> 159</p>
<p class="calibre1">interesting one. It’s getting at how predictable we are, as everybody in the advertising world knows. They know exactly what to put on those billboards and those ads to make us want to buy their products.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Even intelligent people like ourselves are sometimes magnetized by this propaganda because we’re so predictable.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Particularly, we are 100 percent predictable in that if we don’t like something we’ll run the other way, and if we do like it we’ll spend quite a lot of time and effort trying to somehow eat it whole. If someone does something nice for you, you always remember it and you want to repay their kindness. But if somebody hurts you, you remember it for the rest of your life and you always want to get revenge in one way or another. That’s the meaning of this slogan “Don’t be so predictable.” Don’t always react so predictably to pleasure and pain. Don’t keep taking the wrong medicine for the illness.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The next one is very easy to understand: “Don’t malign others.” We put a lot of energy and time into gossiping about others. Perhaps there’s somebody, maybe it’s just one person, that you have a problem with. Maybe it’s Pearl, who is so pitiful. She is always feeling left out, and you find yourself reminded of your mother, who’s also like that. Somehow Pearl and your mother become all mixed up together, and you find yourself continually irritated and disgusted by</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p178"></a>160</p>
<p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre3">Taking Responsibility for Your Own Actions</i> the pitifulness of Pearl, and it keeps triggering a lot of stuff in you. Yet you don’t have the slightest interest in actually getting to know Pearl and finding out what’s going on there. You have no desire to communicate with Pearl and find out who she is. Instead there’s some kind of satisfaction that you get from not liking her, and you spend a lot of time and energy talking to yourself about Pitiful Pearl, or whoever it might be—Horrible Horatio or Miserable Mortimer.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The next one is “Don’t wait in ambush,” yet another</p>
<p class="calibre1">“naked truth” slogan. You have been taught that you should be a nice person; on the other hand, you don’t feel so nice. Maybe you know something about your husband that he doesn’t know you know. You keep it up your sleeve, waiting for just the right moment to spring it on him. One day you’re in the middle of a big argument, very heated. He has just insulted you roy-ally. At that moment you bring the ace down from your sleeve and really let him have it. That’s called waiting in ambush. You are willing to be very patient until just the right moment comes along, and then you let someone have it. This isn’t the path of the warrior, it’s the path of the coward. Not only do you want to “win”; you aren’t even willing to communicate. The aspiration to communicate with another person—to be able to listen and to speak from the heart—is what changes our old stuck patterns.

<a id="p179"></a> <i class="calibre3">Taking Responsibility for Your Own Actions</i> 161<p class="calibre1"></p>
<p class="calibre1">The next slogan, “Don’t bring things to a painful point,” in some way is saying the same thing. These are nuances of the human tragedy, nuances of the tragicomic situation in which we find ourselves.</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Don’t bring things to a painful point” is again saying,</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Don’t humiliate people.” We do all of these things because we feel pain, because we feel hurt and separate. Instead of first making friends with what we’re feeling and then, second, trying to communicate, we have all these ways of keeping the “us and them”</p>
<p class="calibre1">story solid and strong. That’s what causes all the pain on this earth, including the fact that the ecosystem is turned upside down. All of that comes from people not making friends with themselves and never being willing to communicate with the one they consider to be the troublemaker. That’s how we stay caught in this battleground, this war zone.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The next slogan is “Don’t transfer the ox’s load to the cow.” Let’s say you’re Juan’s boss. When something comes along that you find unpleasant and don’t want to do, you pass it on to Juan. You pass the burden to someone else. It’s like that Greek myth about Atlas.</p>
<p class="calibre1">He was just walking along innocently and somebody said, “Oh, Atlas, would you mind for a moment just holding the earth?”</p>
<p class="calibre1">We do that. When we don’t like it, it doesn’t occur to us to actually work with that feeling and communicate with the person who is asking us to do this, to</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p180"></a>162</p>
<p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre3">Taking Responsibility for Your Own Actions</i> somehow open up the situation and work in an honest, fearless way with what’s going on. Instead we just give our burden to somebody else and ask  <i class="calibre3">them  </i> to hold it. It’s called passing the buck.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The next slogan is “Don’t act with a twist.” It means don’t be devious, but it’s similar to those slogans about not eating poisonous food or turning gods into demons. You’re willing to drive all blames into yourself very publicly so everyone will notice, because you want people to think well of you. Your motivation is to get others to think that you’re a great person, which is the “twist.” Or there’s a person who’s doing you wrong, and you remember lojong, but there’s a twist. You don’t say, “Buzz off, Juanita,” or anything harsh. You’re this sweet person who wins everyone’s admiration, but the other side of this is that they dislike Juanita more and more for mistreating you. It’s as if you set Juanita up by acting like a saint. That’s the idea of acting with a twist. There are all kinds of ways to get sweet revenge.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Finally, “Don’t seek others’ pain as the limbs of your own happiness,” which is to say, “Don’t seek others’</p>
<p class="calibre1">pain as a way to get happiness for yourself.” We are glad when the troublemakers in our lives get hit by a truck or go bankrupt, or anything of that nature. I have a few people in my life who fall into this category, and I’m amazed at how happy I am when one of</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p181"></a> <i class="calibre3">Taking Responsibility for Your Own Actions</i> 163</p>
<p class="calibre1">them writes me a letter and tells me that things are going badly. Conversely, I feel haunted by distaste when I hear that things are going well for them.</p>
<p class="calibre1">There’s still the memory of how they hurt me, and I wish they would just continue to go downhill and drop dead, painfully. That’s how we seek others’ pain as the limbs of our own happiness.</p>
<p class="calibre1">These slogans are a curious study of the human species. They reveal that we need to be very honest about what we do. Through seeing these things we can begin to have a lot of compassion, because in studying ourselves we’re studying the whole human race. The monastic rules give us insight into what all these saintly monks and nuns were like at the time of the Buddha. There are rules like Don’t cover your meat with rice so that the server will give you more meat, thinking that you don’t have any. Don’t irritate your roommate on purpose to get the person to leave so that you’ll have the room to yourself. These are actually rules, the code for the monks and nuns coming from the time of the Buddha.</p>
<p class="calibre1">All the cartoons in the world and all the funny movies are made out of what this particular group of slogans is saying. When we are doing things like this, either we don’t see it or we do see it and feel as if we’ve committed a sin, so we either zone out or make a big deal: “I malign others. I’m not fit to live on this earth. What a burden. The more I know myself, the more I see. I’m just continually gossiping. There’s no</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p182"></a>164</p>
<p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre3">Taking Responsibility for Your Own Actions</i> hope for me. Oy vey.” However, we can also just see what we do—not only with honesty but also with a sense of humor—and then keep going and not make a whole identity out of it.</p>
<p class="calibre1">However, we’re still left with a question: when I feel my worst—when I feel jealous or like I need to get revenge—how do I give my best? The first step is to dive into the experience of feeling bad. Make friends with that feeling. The next step is to learn to communicate with the people that you feel are causing your pain and misery—not to learn how to prove them wrong and yourself right but how to communicate from the heart. This is a lifetime’s journey, and a profound one; it’s not something that happens quickly or easily.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p183"></a>1 9</p>
<p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre3">Communication </i></p>
<p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre3">from the Heart</i></p>
<p class="calibre1">Let’s continue with the exploration of compassionate action. We have a strong tendency to distance ourselves from our experience because it hurts, but the dharma provides encouragement to move closer to that experience. Although there are lots of words that could be used to explain compassionate action, I’d like to stress one word, and that word is  <i class="calibre3">communication</i>—in particular, communication from the heart.</p>
<p class="calibre1">“All activities should be done with one intention.”</p>
<p class="calibre1">This one intention is to awaken bodhichitta, to awaken the heart. We could say, “All activities should be done with the intention of communicating.” This is a practical suggestion: all activities should be done with the intention of speaking so that another person can hear you, rather than using words that cause the barriers to go up and the ears to close. In this process we also learn how to listen and how to look.
</p><p class="calibre1">

<p class="calibre1"><a id="p184"></a>166</p>
<p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre3">Communication from the Heart</i></p>
<p class="calibre1">There is an extremely pointed slogan that goes along with “All activities should be done with one intention”: “Always meditate on whatever provokes resentment.” Instead of the resentment being an obstacle, it’s a reminder. Feeling irritated, restless, afraid, and hopeless is a reminder to listen more carefully. It’s a reminder to stop talking; watch and listen. It’s a reminder to use tonglen practice to allow some space.</p>
<p class="calibre1">For example, you hate this person who is standing in front of you. You just wanted to help a hungry person get food, and then you find yourself talking to the enemy—a bureaucrat, a politician,  <i class="calibre3">them. </i> All you do is get more and more angry at them, so nothing happens. They grow more stubborn as you grow more furious and polarized and the sense of huge  <i class="calibre3">me </i> versus huge  <i class="calibre3">them </i> increases.</p>
<p class="calibre1">When we feel resentment, the words that we speak, the actions that we perform, and the thoughts that we have aren’t going to produce the results that we’re hoping for. Beyond that, we’re so aggressive that we’re not exactly adding any peace and harmony to the world. Resentment becomes a reminder not to feel bad about ourselves but to open further to the pain and to the awkwardness.</p>
<p class="calibre1">If we really want to communicate, we have to give up knowing what to do. When we come in with our agendas, they only block us from seeing the person in front of us. It’s best to drop our five-year plans and ac-</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p185"></a> <i class="calibre3">Communication from the Heart</i> 167</p>
<p class="calibre1">cept the awkward sinking feeling that we are entering a situation naked. We don’t know what will happen next or what we’ll do.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The slogan “Keep the three inseparable” is saying that your actions, your speech, and your thoughts should be inseparable from this yearning to communicate from the heart. Everything you say can further polarize the situation and convince you of how separate you are. On the other hand, everything you say and do and think can support your desire to communicate, to move closer and step out of this myth of isolation and separateness that you’re caught in.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Usually when we feel wronged, our only intention is to get revenge. The slogan “Correct all wrongs with one intention” is trying to cheer us up a bit, lighten up the situation, and add some space. The “one intention” is to exchange oneself for other. This is the key. To correct all wrongs with one intention is to hear what’s being said, to see the person who is in front of you, and to be able to rest in not knowing what to say or how to act but just to watch and wait.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Then out of your mouth comes something, because the person in front of you is saying, “Well, what do you think?” or “I don’t know, see if you can convince me to do it your way,” or they’re just yelling at you.</p>
<p class="calibre1">If simply to learn how to communicate were our</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p186"></a>168</p>
<p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre3">Communication from the Heart</i></p>
<p class="calibre1">life’s challenge, not only might we be able to help find food for people who are hungry and shelter for people who are homeless, but we might even see a fundamental change—less aggression on the planet and more cooperation.</p>
<p class="calibre1">We  <i class="calibre3">are </i> different; we are very different from each other. One person’s idea of what is polite is someone else’s idea of what is rude. In some cultures it’s considered rude to belch when you’re eating, and in others it shows that you enjoyed your meal. What might smell repulsive to one person might smell wonderful to another. We are really different, and we have to acknowledge that. But instead of going to war because of our differences, let’s play soccer. It will be a strange game, given our instruction to let others have the victory and keep the defeat to ourselves, but that doesn’t mean that we play to lose; it means that we play to  <i class="calibre3">play. </i> We could play  <i class="calibre3">together, </i> even though we’re on opposite teams. There are no big stakes, just playing. There are different teams; otherwise the game won’t work. But it doesn’t have to lead to World War III or the destruction of the planet.</p>
<p class="calibre1">One of my favorite dharma teachers is Dr. Seuss; he captures the human condition so beautifully. One of his stories starts with two people walking toward each other along a narrow road. When they meet, they each refuse to step to the side so that the other can pass. Everyone else builds bridges and even whole cities around them, and life just goes on. But</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p187"></a> <i class="calibre3">Communication from the Heart</i> 169</p>
<p class="calibre1">the two stubborn ones stand there for the rest of time, refusing to budge. It never occurs to them even after eighty-five years that they could be curious about why the other is refusing to move, or that they could try to communicate. They could have had a really interesting debate in all those years even if they had still never moved.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The point is not that you’re trying to achieve harmony or smooth everything out. Good luck, if that’s your goal. The point is to live together on this earth with our differences, to communicate for its own sake. The process is the main thing, not the fruition.</p>
<p class="calibre1">If you achieve your goal with aggressive tactics, nothing really changes anyway.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Dr. Seuss tells another story about the Sneetches.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The superior race, the ones that everybody aspires to be like and also the ones that everybody hates, are the Star-Belly Sneetches; they have stars on their bellies, and everybody else doesn’t. One very clever fellow knew how predictable these Sneetches were, so he came in with a big machine that would put a star on your belly. All the Sneetches  <i class="calibre3">without </i> a star on their belly rushed in and came out  <i class="calibre3">with  </i> a star on their belly, but of course the original Star-Belly Sneetches still knew who—and how superior—they were. They weren’t thrown by this at all. But to facilitate this very predictable situation, the same clever fellow came along with a new machine by which you could go in and get the star taken  <i class="calibre3">off </i> your belly. So all the Star-</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p188"></a>170</p>
<p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre3">Communication from the Heart</i></p>
<p class="calibre1">Belly Sneetches went into this machine and came out without stars on their belly; the superior ones were now without stars.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The clever fellow kept these two machines going.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Sneetches were running in and out, and the money was piling up, but after awhile all the Sneetches experienced shunyata. They didn’t know who was who or what was what or who was a Star-Belly Sneetch and who was a non–Star-Belly Sneetch, so after awhile they just had to look at each other without labels or opinions.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Another slogan says, “Train without bias in all areas.</p>
<p class="calibre1">It is crucial always to do this pervasively and wholeheartedly.” Train without bias, that’s the trick. Train without bias, without the labels. This is supported by the whole tonglen practice and lojong teaching, which encourage us to see bias when it comes up and begin to connect with how painful that is, to feel the prejudice, the resentment, the judgment. It’s a powerful, compassionate teaching because it respects our intelligence and our innate good heart. It simply says, “Begin to see what you do, and don’t necessarily try to change it; just see it.” That’s how things begin to change. When we say, “Train without bias,” the first step is to meditate on bias when you see it arising.</p>
<p class="calibre1">This is the same as “Always meditate on whatever provokes resentment.” Then one begins to be able to train meticulously and pervasively in all situations.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p189"></a> <i class="calibre3">Communication from the Heart</i> 171</p>
<p class="calibre1">Often tonglen is taught exactly as this slogan describes—as a way of training pervasively and meticulously with everyone. You can do this practice in any situation. You start with yourself. You can extend the practice to situations in which compassion spontaneously arises, exchanging yourself for someone you want to help. Then you move on to a slightly more difficult area.</p>
<p class="calibre1">This slogan is saying you should extend this practice to everyone, pervasively, not excluding anyone.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Move the practice out to what are commonly called neutrals. These are probably the most frequent relationships that we have. They’re people we never get to know and aren’t even interested in. They’re the ones who sit on the sidewalks and don’t have any homes, whom we walk past very fast because it’s too painful. They’re the other people who are also walking by very quickly. Beginning to do tonglen for the ones we haven’t noticed might be a difficult practice, but it could be the most valuable—to begin as you walk through the streets of your life to look at the people that you didn’t notice before and become curious about them.</p>
<p class="calibre1">When we encounter life situations that spontaneously evoke compassion, it is not necessary to go through all four stages. It’s fine to begin with the third stage, the stage of breathing in the pain in the situation that confronts us and breathing out something that will help. It’s fine to breathe in the pain and send</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p190"></a>172</p>
<p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre3">Communication from the Heart</i></p>
<p class="calibre1">out relief or love. There is no need to do the other parts—flashing absolute bodhichitta or working with the black, heavy, and hot and white, light, and cool.</p>
<p class="calibre1">These can be skipped in daily life when you do tonglen on the spot.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The key to compassionate action is this: everybody needs someone to be there for them, simply to be there.</p>
<p class="calibre1">A friend was severely burned and disfigured. Later she was able to have plastic surgery to improve her looks, but there was a long time when it was difficult to look at her. This was a time of intense isolation.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The nurses would just pop into the room and say cheery things and then get out of there as fast as they could. The doctors would march in and say efficient things and look at her charts, but not at her. All who encountered her kept their distance because the sight of her was too troubling, too disturbing. This was even true of her family and friends. People made their duty calls, but there was some sense of not wanting to relate with the horror of this disfigured person. Finally some hospice people started to come.</p>
<p class="calibre1">They would sit there and hold her hand, just be there. They didn’t know what to say or what she really needed, but they weren’t afraid of her, and she realized that what people really need is for others not to be afraid of them and not to distance themselves from them.</p>
<p class="calibre1">That’s what tonglen provides—a support for us</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p191"></a> <i class="calibre3">Communication from the Heart</i> 173</p>
<p class="calibre1">just to be there with another human being and try to communicate. Sometimes there’s nothing to be said and nothing to be done. Then the deepest communication of all is just to be there.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The practice goes further. We start with the self, extend out to situations where compassion naturally arises, move out further to this area of neutrals, and then we move to enemies. “Be grateful to every Juan.”</p>
<p class="calibre1">To be truthful, probably no one in this room feels ready to do tonglen for an enemy. Just the word <i class="calibre3">enemy </i> is a problem, a label with a lot of emotion behind it, a lot of anger behind it, and a lot of soft spot behind it. Basically you have to start where you are with your loathing or whatever it is you feel, but with an aspiration to widen the circle of compassion.</p>
<p class="calibre1">I’ve found in my own history of working with this practice of awakening bodhichitta that the circle of compassion widens at its own speed and widens spontaneously; it’s not something you can make happen. It’s definitely not something you can fake. But I guess there’s a little bit of encouragement to at least experiment with faking it occasionally by seeing what happens when you try to do tonglen for your enemy.</p>
<p class="calibre1">There’s a lot of encouragement just to try this and see what happens when your enemy is standing in front of you or you’re intentionally bringing up the memory of your enemy in order to do tonglen in the meditation hall. Think of this simple instruction: what would it take to be able to communicate with my</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p192"></a>174</p>
<p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre3">Communication from the Heart</i></p>
<p class="calibre1">enemy? What would it take to be able to have my enemy hear what I’m trying to say, and what would it take for me to be able to hear what he or she is trying to say to me? How to communicate from the heart is the essence of what tonglen is about.</p>
<p class="calibre1">You can extend even further to all sentient beings, which involves seeing that this practice is extraordi-narily vast. Of course, we could use the notion of “all sentient beings” to distance ourselves from pain, to make the immediate, relative situation more abstract and far away. Someone said to me in all seriousness,</p>
<p class="calibre1">“I have a very easy time doing tonglen for all sentient beings, but I have a little trouble doing it for my husband.” Doing tonglen for all sentient beings doesn’t have to be separate from doing it for yourself and your immediate situation. That’s the point that has been made again and again. When you connect with your own suffering, reflect that countless beings at this very moment are feeling exactly what you feel.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Their story line is different, but the feeling of pain is the same. When you do the practice both for all sentient beings and for yourself, you begin to realize that self and other are not actually different.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p193"></a>2 0</p>
<p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre3">The Big Squeeze</i></p>
<p class="calibre1">If we wantto communicate and we have a strong aspiration to help others—on the level of social action, on the level of our family, at work in our community, or we just want to be there for people when they need us—then sooner or later we’re going to experience the big squeeze. Our ideals and the reality of what’s really happening don’t match. We feel as if we’re between the fingers of a big giant who is squeezing us. We find ourselves between a rock and a hard place.</p>
<p class="calibre1">There is often a discrepancy between our ideals and what we actually encounter. For instance, with raising children, we have a lot of good ideas, but sometimes it’s very challenging to put together all the good ideas with the way our children really are, there at the breakfast table with food all over themselves. Or with meditation, have you noticed how difficult it is to actually feel emotions without getting totally swept away by them, or how difficult it is simply to cultivate friendliness toward yourself when you’re feeling completely miserable or pan-icked or caught up?</p>
<p class="calibre1">175</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p194"></a>176</p>
<p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre3">The Big Squeeze</i></p>
<p class="calibre1">There’s a discrepancy between your inspiration and the situation as it presents itself, the immediacy of the situation. It’s the rub between those two things—the squeeze between reality and vision—</p>
<p class="calibre1">that causes you to grow up, to wake up to be 100 percent decent, alive, and compassionate.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The big squeeze is one of the most productive places on the spiritual path and in particular in this journey of awakening the heart. It’s worth talking about because when we find ourselves in that place again and again, usually we want to run away; sometimes we want to give up the whole thing. It’s like</p>
<p class="calibre1">“burn out”: it feels extremely uncomfortable and you can’t wiggle out of it. It’s like a dog that gets its teeth in your arm and you just can’t shake it off. Times of the big squeeze feel like crisis periods. We have the aspiration to wake up and to help and at the same time it doesn’t seem to work out on our terms. It feels impossible for us to buy our situation and also impossible to throw it out. Being caught in the big squeeze humbles you, and at the same time, it has great vision. This is the interesting part—it softens you and yet it has a big perspective.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Through meditation practice we learn not to reject, but also not to grasp. This is the same paradox that we are presented with in our lives. It’s not so much that you do or don’t reject, it’s more that sometimes you find that you can’t do either or that you do both at the same time.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p195"></a> <i class="calibre3">The Big Squeeze</i></p>
<p class="calibre1">177</p>
<p class="calibre1">I was invited to teach in a situation with the Sawang, Trungpa Rinpoche’s eldest son, in which it wasn’t exactly clear what my status was. Sometimes I was treated as a big deal who should come in through a special door and sit in a special seat. Then I’d think,</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Okay, I’m a big deal.” I’d start running with that idea and come up with big-deal notions about how things should be, and then I’d get the messages back, “Oh, no, no, no. You should just sit on the floor and mix with everybody and be one of the crowd.” Okay. So now the message was that I should just be ordinary, not set myself up or be the teacher. But as soon as I was getting comfortable with being humble, I would be asked to do some special something or other that only big deals did. This was a painful experience because I was always being insulted and humiliated by my own expectations. As soon as I was sure how it should be, so I could feel secure, I would get a message that it should be the other way.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Finally I said to the Sawang, “This is really hurting.</p>
<p class="calibre1">I just don’t know who I’m supposed to be,” and he said, “Well, you have to learn to be big and small at the same time.” I think that’s the point. We can always get comfortable being either big  <i class="calibre3">or </i> small, either right  <i class="calibre3">or </i> wrong.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Although we think that wrong is bad, if we get into the habit of thinking that we are wrong, that can be quite comfortable too.  <i class="calibre3">Any  </i> ground will do; we just want to be able to get our ground, either as a loser or</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p196"></a>178</p>
<p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre3">The Big Squeeze</i></p>
<p class="calibre1">as a winner, as a big deal or an ordinary deal. But if we wish to communicate, if we really wish to open our hearts, sooner or later we are going to find ourselves in the big squeeze, where we can’t buy it and we can’t throw it out, and we are caught in the juicy situation of being big and small at the same time.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Life is glorious, but life is also wretched. It is both.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Appreciating the gloriousness inspires us, encourages us, cheers us up, gives us a bigger perspective, energizes us. We feel connected. But if that’s all that’s happening, we get arrogant and start to look down on others, and there is a sense of making ourselves a big deal and being really serious about it, wanting it to be like that forever. The gloriousness becomes tinged by craving and addiction.</p>
<p class="calibre1">On the other hand, wretchedness—life’s painful aspect—softens us up considerably. Knowing pain is a very important ingredient of being there for another person. When you are feeling a lot of grief, you can look right into somebody’s eyes because you feel you haven’t got anything to lose—you’re just there. The wretchedness humbles us and softens us, but if we were only wretched, we would all just go down the tubes. We’d be so depressed, discouraged, and hopeless that we wouldn’t have enough energy to eat an apple. Gloriousness and wretchedness need each other. One inspires us, the other softens us. They go together.

<p class="calibre1">Today’s slogans are instructions on how to communicate from the heart. The emphasis is on how to keep one’s heart open for the juiciness and richness of the big squeeze. One of the slogans is “Whichever of the two occurs, be patient.” Whether it is glorious or wretched, delightful or hateful, be patient. Patience means allowing things to unfold at their own speed rather than jumping in with your habitual response to either pain or pleasure. The real happiness that underlies both gloriousness and wretchedness often gets short-circuited by our jumping too fast into the same habitual pattern.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Patience is not learned in safety. It is not learned when everything is harmonious and going well.</p>
<p class="calibre1">When everything is smooth sailing, who needs patience? If you stay in your room with the door locked and the curtains drawn, everything may seem harmonious, but the minute anything doesn’t go your way, you blow up. There is no cultivation of patience when your pattern is to just try to seek harmony and smooth everything out. Patience implies willingness to be alive rather than trying to seek harmony.</p>
<p class="calibre1">A hermit well known for his austerity had been practicing in a cave for twenty years. An unconventional teacher named Patrul Rinpoche showed up at the cave, and the hermit humbly and sweetly wel-comed him in. Patrul Rinpoche said, “Tell me, what have you been doing here?” “I’ve been practicing the perfection of patience,” the hermit answered.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p198"></a>180</p>
<p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre3">The Big Squeeze</i></p>
<p class="calibre1">Putting his face very close to the hermit’s face, Patrul Rinpoche said, “But a pair of old scoundrels like us, we don’t care anything about patience really. We only do this to get everyone’s admiration, right? We just do this to get people to think we are big shots, don’t we?” And the hermit started getting irritated. But Patrul Rinpoche wouldn’t stop. He just kept laughing and patting him on the back and saying, “Yeah, we sure know how to dupe people, don’t we? We really know. I’ll bet they bring you a lot of gifts, don’t they?”</p>
<p class="calibre1">At this point the hermit stood up and screamed,</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Why did you come here? Why are you tormenting me? Go away and leave me in peace!” And then the Rinpoche said, “So now, where is your perfection of patience?” So that’s the point. We can create the ideal situation in which we have a very high opinion of ourselves, but how do we do when it comes to the big squeeze?</p>
<p class="calibre1">The next slogan is “Don’t be swayed by external circumstances.” If something is glorious or even just slightly pleasant, you say, “Wow! I want that.” If it’s wretched or even just slightly irritating, you say, “I want   <i class="calibre3">out  </i> of it!” The point is that challenges don’t cease, and if you wish to keep your heart open, the challenges will quickly increase rather than decrease. Harmony may seem a distant hope.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Lest you be hard on yourself about being swayed by external circumstances, keep in mind the story of</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p199"></a> <i class="calibre3">The Big Squeeze</i></p>
<p class="calibre1">181</p>
<p class="calibre1">Shakyamuni Buddha. Just before the moment of his enlightenment, all of the external circumstances came to try to sway him in the form of the daughters of Mara. (Mara symbolizes the ways we have of looking for alternatives to being where we are.) Just before he was enlightened, every kind of idea occurred to the Buddha. It was as if every challenge in the book came up. On that evening what was different was that he simply held his seat, opened his heart to whatever might arise, didn’t shut down, and was fully there. Lest you feel bad about yourself, not being swayed by external circumstances as a total experience is called enlightenment.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The slogan “Don’t vacillate” very much goes along with not being swayed by external circumstances.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Whatever arises, you can keep your heart open. Beyond that, you can see shutting down or closing off as an opportunity to wake up. Spinning off when things are painful or pleasant presents an opportunity to practice lojong. You have good instructions on what to do with pain, breathing it in, becoming more intimate and making friends with it; you have instructions on what to do with pleasure, sending it out, giving away what you are most unwilling to lose. In this way we can begin to know the pain of others and wish for others to have happiness, using the joy and pleasure of our lives not as problems but as tools for benefiting others.</p>

The next slogan is “Don’t expect applause,” which means “Don’t expect thanks.” This is important.<p class="calibre1"></p>
<p class="calibre1">When you open the door and invite all sentient beings as your guests, and not only that, but you also open the windows, and the walls even start falling down, you find yourself in the universe with no protection at all. Now you’re in for it. If you think that just by doing that you are going to feel good about yourself, and you are going to be thanked right and left—no, that won’t happen. More than to expect thanks, it would be helpful just to expect the unexpected; then you might be curious and inquisitive about what comes in the door. We can begin to open our hearts to others when we have no hope of getting anything back. We just do it for its own sake.</p>
<p class="calibre1">On the other hand, it’s good to express our gratitude to others. It’s helpful to express our appreciation of others. But if we do that with the motivation of wanting them to like us, we can remember this slogan. We can thank others, but we should give up all hope of getting thanked back. Simply keep the door open without expectations.</p>
<p class="calibre1">There is also a slogan that says “Don’t misinterpret.”</p>
<p class="calibre1">Don’t impose the wrong notion of what harmony is, what compassion is, what patience is, what generosity is. Don’t misinterpret what these things really are.</p>
<p class="calibre1">There is compassion and there is  <i class="calibre3">idiot </i> compassion;</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p201"></a> <i class="calibre3">The Big Squeeze</i></p>
<p class="calibre1">183</p>
<p class="calibre1">there is patience and there is  <i class="calibre3">idiot </i> patience; there is generosity and there is  <i class="calibre3">idiot </i> generosity. For example, trying to smooth everything out to avoid confrontation, not to rock the boat, is not what’s meant by compassion or patience. It’s what is meant by control.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Then you are not trying to step into unknown territory, to find yourself more naked with less protection and therefore more in contact with reality. Instead, you use the idiot forms of compassion and so forth just to get ground. When you open the door and invite in all sentient beings as your guests, you have to drop your agenda. Many different people come in.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Just when you think you have a little scheme that is going to work, it doesn’t work. It was very beneficial to Juan, but when you tried it on Mortimer, he looked at you as if you were crazy, and when you try it on Juanita, she gets insulted.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Coming up with a formula won’t work. If you invite all sentient beings as your guests while just wanting harmony, sooner or later you’ll find that one of your guests is behaving badly and that just sitting there cheerfully doing your tonglen and trying to cultivate harmony doesn’t work.</p>
<p class="calibre1">So you sit there and you say, “Okay, now I’m going to make friends with the fact that I am hurting and afraid, and this is really awful.” But you are just trying to avoid conflict here; you just don’t want to make things worse. Then all the guests are misbehaving; you work hard all day and they just sit around, smok-</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p202"></a>184</p>
<p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre3">The Big Squeeze</i></p>
<p class="calibre1">ing cigarettes, drinking beer, eating your food, and then beating you up. You think you’re being a warrior and a bodhisattva by doing nothing and saying nothing, but what you’re being is a coward. You’re just afraid of making the situation worse. Finally they kick you out of your house and you’re sitting on the sidewalk. Somebody walks by and says, “What are you doing sitting out here?” You answer, “I am practicing patience and compassion.” That’s missing the point.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Even though you’ve dropped your agenda, even though you are trying to work  <i class="calibre3">with </i> situations instead of struggling  <i class="calibre3">against  </i> them, nevertheless you may have to say, “You can stay here tonight, but tomorrow you’re going, and if you don’t get out of here, I am calling the police.” You don’t really know what’s going to benefit somebody, but it doesn’t benefit anybody to allow someone to beat you up, eat all your food, and put you out on the street.</p>
<p class="calibre1">So “Don’t misinterpret” really gets at the notion of the big squeeze. It’s saying that you don’t know what’s going to help, but you need to speak and act with clarity and decisiveness. Clarity and decisiveness come from the willingness to slow down, to listen to and look at what’s happening. They come from opening your heart and not running away. Then the action and the speech are in accord with what needs to be done, for you and for the other person.</p>
<p class="calibre1">We make a lot of mistakes. If you ask people whom</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p203"></a> <i class="calibre3">The Big Squeeze</i></p>
<p class="calibre1">185</p>
<p class="calibre1">you consider to be wise and courageous about their lives, you may find that they have hurt a lot of people and made a lot of mistakes, but that they used those occasions as opportunities to humble themselves and open their hearts. We don’t get wise by staying in a room with all the doors and windows closed.</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Train in the three difficulties” is my favorite slogan because it acknowledges that this path is difficult, all right, but it’s a good way to spend our time. There are three difficulties. The first is  <i class="calibre3">seeing neurosis as neurosis, </i> and the second is  <i class="calibre3">being willing to do something</i> <i class="calibre3">different. </i> The third difficulty is  <i class="calibre3">the aspiration to make</i> <i class="calibre3">this a way of life. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre3">Seeing neurosis as neurosis</i>. The first difficulty is to see what you do. There is a slogan that goes along with that that says, “Liberate yourself by examining and analyzing.” This is an interesting point, to be able to see what we do without hating ourselves. This can also be a description of  <i class="calibre3">maitri</i>—loving-kindness. We could see what we do with honesty but with gentleness. We could see what we do and realize that that’s our first experience of the big squeeze. It’s the path of a warrior, seeing what we do without turning it against ourselves.</p>
<p class="calibre1">This slogan about liberating yourself by examining and analyzing simply means, as with the slogans</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Don’t be jealous,” “Don’t be frivolous,” and “Don’t</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p204"></a>186</p>
<p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre3">The Big Squeeze</i></p>
<p class="calibre1">wallow in self-pity,” that the first step is to  <i class="calibre3">see </i> yourself jealous,  <i class="calibre3">see </i> yourself frivolous,  <i class="calibre3">see </i> yourself wallowing in self-pity. You think to yourself, “Well, what would Dr. Seuss do in this situation?” Instead of using it as ammunition against yourself, you can lighten up and realize it’s the information that you need in order to keep your heart open. If everybody on the planet could experience seeing what they do with gentleness, everything would start to turn around very fast, even if we didn’t get to the second difficulty.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre3">Doing something different</i>. The second difficulty is to do something different. Even if you see what you do, can you then do something different? If you’re jealous, can you snap your fingers and no longer be jealous? We all know it’s more difficult than that.</p>
<p class="calibre1">You’re sitting there and your boyfriend is sitting across the room with somebody else having a really good time, and you’re getting more jealous and furious by the minute. There’s a little bird on your shoulder who says, “OK, here’s your big chance. You could use this to wake up.” And you say, “Forget it! He’s really a creep. I want to be mad at him. He deserves my anger.” Now the little bird is jumping up and down, saying, “Hey, hey, hey, hey! Don’t you remember?</p>
<p class="calibre1">Don’t you remember?” You’re saying, “I don’t believe this stuff! I am right to be jealous, and he is horrible!”</p>
<p class="calibre1">There you are. The little bird jumps up to the other shoulder and pulls on your earlobe and says, “Come</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p205"></a> <i class="calibre3">The Big Squeeze</i></p>
<p class="calibre1">187</p>
<p class="calibre1">on, come on! Give yourself a break. Get to know this stuff. Drop the story line.” “Forget it!” you say. Boy are you stubborn.</p>
<p class="calibre1">That’s what I find about myself. Even when we’re given the methods for how to give ourselves a break, we are so stubborn. If you think smoking is hard to give up, try giving up your habitual patterns. It leaves you with the same kind of queasy feeling that you have when giving up any other addiction.</p>
<p class="calibre1">So instead of “liberating yourself by examining and analyzing,” the habitual response to seeing yourself clearly is to take the wrong medicine: you inflame the jealousy, you wallow more in self-pity, you speed up the frivolity. Usually we do this by talking to ourselves. It’s like a bellows fanning a fire. We just sit there, and we have fantasies about our boyfriend leaving the party with our friend, or we talk to ourselves about how it’s hopeless and how we always feel like this and how it’s never going to get better.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Do something different, such as tonglen.  <i class="calibre3">Anything</i> different would help, anything that’s not habitual.</p>
<p class="calibre1">For example, you could go up and take a cold shower and sing at the top of your lungs, or drink a glass of water from the wrong side, like you do when you are trying to get rid of hiccups.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre3">Continuing that way</i>. But even if you see what you do and even if you do something different, the third difficulty is that it’s difficult to continue that way, to cut</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p206"></a>188</p>
<p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre3">The Big Squeeze</i></p>
<p class="calibre1">the habitual pattern as a way of life. So whenever you see yourself spinning off in some kind of habitual way, you could aspire to catch yourself and to do something different as a way of cultivating compassion for yourself and compassion for others. But don’t be surprised or give up when it’s difficult.</p>
<p class="calibre1">A slogan that encourages practicing the three difficulties is “Two activities: one at the beginning, one at the end.” At the beginning of your day when you wake up, express your aspiration: “May I practice the three difficulties. May I see what I do. When it happens, may I do something different, and may that be a way of life for me.” At the beginning of your day, using your own language, you could encourage yourself to keep your heart open, to remain curious, no matter how difficult things get. Then at the end of the day when you’re just about to go to sleep, review the day. Rather than using what happened as ammunition for feeling bad about yourself, about how the whole day went by and you never once remembered what you had aspired to do in the morning, you can simply use it as an opportunity to get to know yourself better and to see all the funny ways in which you trick yourself, all the ways in which you’re so good at zoning out and shutting down. If you feel like you don’t want to practice the three difficulties anymore because it’s like setting yourself up for failure, gener-ate a kind heart toward yourself. Reflecting over just</p>

<p class="calibre1">189</p>
<p class="calibre1">one day’s activities can be painful, but you may end up respecting yourself more, because you see that a lot happened; you weren’t just one way. As Carl Jung said at the end of his life, “I am astonished, disappointed, pleased with myself. I am distressed, depressed, rapturous. I am all these things at once and cannot add up the sum.”</p>
<p class="calibre1">So that’s the big squeeze. Although you listen to all these teachings, and you have all these practices as a support, somehow it has to become real for you. It has to be digested by you. The teachings and practices are like orange juice concentrate—that thick orange stuff in the can—and life is like the water. You have to mix it all together. Then you have good orange juice that you can bring out in a big pitcher for everyone to drink. And even though it came out of a can, you know that it’s truly freshly squeezed.</p>

<p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre3">HighStakes Practice</i></p>
<p class="calibre1">Pogo said, “We have met the enemy and they are us.” This particular slogan now appears a lot in the environmental movement. It isn’t somebody else who’s polluting the rivers—it’s us. The cause of confusion and bewilderment and pollution and violence isn’t really someone else’s problem: it’s something we can come to know in ourselves. But in order to do that we have to understand that  <i class="calibre3">we have met the</i> <i class="calibre3">friend and that is me</i>. The more we make friends with ourselves, the more we can see that our ways of shutting down and closing off are rooted in the mistaken thinking that the way to get happy is to blame somebody else.</p>
<p class="calibre1">It’s a little uncertain who is “us” and who is “them.”</p>
<p class="calibre1">Bernard Glassman Sensei, who does a lot of work with the homeless in New York, said that he doesn’t work with the homeless because he’s such a great guy but because going into the areas of society that he has rejected is the only way to make friends with the parts of himself that he’s rejected. It’s all interrelated.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre3">We work on ourselves in order to help others, but also</i> <i class="calibre3">we help others in order to work on ourselves. </i> That’s a very important point. We could say that working with 190</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p209"></a> <i class="calibre3">HighStakes Practice</i></p>
<p class="calibre1">191</p>
<p class="calibre1">others is a highstakes maitri practice, because when we start to work with others, somehow they all seem to end up looking like Juan or Juanita. If we are wholehearted about wanting to be there for other people without shutting anybody or anything out of our hearts, our pretty little self-image of how kind or compassionate we are gets completely blown. We’re always being tested and we’re always meeting our match. The more you’re willing to open your heart, the more challenges come along that make you want to shut it.</p>
<p class="calibre1">You can’t do this work in a safety zone. You have to go out into the marketplace and live your life like everybody else, but with the added ingredient of not wanting to shut anything out of your heart. Maitri—</p>
<p class="calibre1">loving-kindness—has to go very deep, because when you practice it, you’re going to see everything about yourself. Every time your buttons get pushed is like a big mirror showing you your own face, and like the evil stepmother in “Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs,” you want the mirror to tell you what you want to hear—even if it’s that you haven’t been kind or that you’re selfish. Somehow you can even use your insight into your limitations to keep yourself feeling all right.</p>
<p class="calibre1">What we don’t want is any  <i class="calibre3">unforeseen </i> feedback from the mirror. What we don’t want is to be naked, exposed. We have blind spots, and we put a lot of energy into staying blind. One day the wicked step-</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p210"></a>192</p>
<p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre3">HighStakes Practice</i></p>
<p class="calibre1">mother went to the mirror and said, “Mirror, mirror, on the wall, who’s the fairest of them all?” and instead of, “You are, sweetheart,” the mirror said, “Snow White.” And just like us, she didn’t want to hear it.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Nevertheless, I think we all know that there’s no point in blaming the mirror when it shows you your own face, and there’s certainly no point in breaking the mirror.</p>
<p class="calibre1">I once knew a very powerful woman who always managed to have everything go her way. The epitome of her approach to life was that she had a scale in her bathroom that was always turned down so that when she stood on it she weighed exactly what she wanted to weigh. When you look in the mirror and see that you have a big pimple on the end of your nose, and you decide to actually see it and let yourself wince and feel the embarrassment and nevertheless just go about your business, then when a five-year-old comes rushing up to you and says, “Hey lady, you have a big pimple on the end of your nose!” you just say,</p>
<p class="calibre1">“I know.” But if you try to cover that pimple over with cosmetics or a nosebag, you are shocked and offended when it turns out that everyone can see it anyway.</p>
<p class="calibre1">This tendency to refer back to ourselves, to try to protect ourselves, is so strong and all-pervasive. A simple way of turning it around is to develop our curiosity and our inquisitiveness about everything. This is another way of talking about helping others, but of</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p211"></a> <i class="calibre3">HighStakes Practice</i></p>
<p class="calibre1">193</p>
<p class="calibre1">course the process also helps us. The whole path seems to be about developing curiosity, about looking out and taking an interest in all the details of our lives and in our immediate environment.</p>
<p class="calibre1">When we find ourselves in a situation in which our buttons are being pushed, we can choose to repress or act out, or we can choose to practice. If we can start to do the exchange, breathing in with the intention of keeping our hearts open to the embarrassment or fear or anger that we feel, then to our surprise we find that we’re also open to what the other person is feeling. Open heart is open heart.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Once it’s open, your eyes and your mind are also open, and you can see what’s happening in the faces and hearts of other people. If you’re walking down the street and way off in the distance—so far away that you can’t possibly do anything about it—you see a man beating his dog, and you feel helpless, you can start to do the exchange. You start out doing it for the dog, then you find you’re doing it for the man.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Then you’re also doing it for your own heartbreak and for all the animals and people who are abusing and abused, and for all the people like you who are watching and don’t know what to do. Simply by doing this exchange you have made the world a larger, more loving place.</p>
<p class="calibre1">There’s a traditional teaching about regarding all sentient beings as your mother. Everyone has been your mother; they’ve been kind to you and you’ve had</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p212"></a>194</p>
<p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre3">HighStakes Practice</i></p>
<p class="calibre1">an intimate relationship with them. This teaching always seemed old-fashioned to me. Then I read a book by Joanna Macy in which she recounted being in India and hearing a Tibetan teach on this subject.</p>
<p class="calibre1">It was so boring that she went outside to get some air.</p>
<p class="calibre1">As she was walking along a path, toward her came an old woman, bent under a load of wood that she was carrying on her back. Suddenly she thought, “This woman was once my mother.” Even though she had walked past lots of men and women like this in India, people carrying heavy loads and all bent over so that you couldn’t even see their faces, she wanted to see the face of this woman. She wanted to know who this woman was, because all she could think about was how this woman had been her mother.</p>
<p class="calibre1">I learned something from Joanna Macy’s story: this teaching that all sentient beings have been our mothers is about taking an interest in other people, about being curious, and about being kind. All those name-less people in the street, they’ve been your lovers, your brothers and sisters, your fathers and mothers, your children, your friends. Even if you don’t buy that, you can just wonder who they are and begin to look at them with some interest and curiosity. Everyone is just like us. We all have our lives; we think that we’re the center of the universe, and none of us is paying too much attention to anyone else unless things get very passionate or very aggressive.

<a id="p213"></a> <i class="calibre3">HighStakes Practice</i><p class="calibre1"></p>
<p class="calibre1">195</p>
<p class="calibre1">Today’s slogan is “Take on the three principal causes.”</p>
<p class="calibre1">The three principal causes are what help us to keep our heart open, to remember to exchange ourselves for others, and to communicate. They are the teacher, the teachings, and a precious human birth.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre3">The teacher. </i> First we’ll consider the teacher. In the lojong teachings the teacher is referred to as the spiritual friend, the  <i class="calibre3">kalyanamitra. </i> The teacher is like a senior warrior, or a student warrior who’s further along the path. It’s somebody who inspires you to walk the path of warriorship yourself. Looking at them reminds you of your own softness, your own clarity of mind, and your own ability to continually step out and open. Something about them speaks to your heart; you want to have a friendship with this person as a teacher. Trust is an essential ingredient: if you enter into a serious relationship with a teacher, you make a commitment to stick with them and they make a commitment to stick with you, so you’re stuck together.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Lest one romanticize this relationship, I’d like to repeat something that Trungpa Rinpoche once said:</p>
<p class="calibre1">“The role of the spiritual friend is to insult you.” This is true. It isn’t that the spiritual friend phones you up and calls you names or sends you letters about what a jerk you are. It’s more that the spiritual friend is the ultimate Juan. All your blind spots are going to come out with the spiritual friend. The only difference be-</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p214"></a>196</p>
<p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre3">HighStakes Practice</i></p>
<p class="calibre1">tween the spiritual friend and everybody else in your life is that you’ve made a commitment to stick with him or her through thick or thin, better or worse, richer or poorer, in sickness and in death. We’re not too good at keeping commitments these days; this isn’t an age where commitment is honored very widely. If you enter into a relationship with a spiritual friend, you’re really asking for it. Rather than the cozy, nurturing situation you might have imagined in the beginning—that the teacher is always kind and will replace the mother or father who never loved you or is finally the friend who has unconditional love for you—you find that in this relationship you begin to see the pimples on your nose, and the mirror on the wall isn’t telling you that you’re the fairest of them all.</p>
<p class="calibre1">To the degree that anything is hidden in this relationship, you begin to see it.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Spending time with Trungpa Rinpoche felt like the great exposé. Often he would say very little. You’d have some seemingly enormous problem. When you finally got to talk with him, it didn’t seem so important anymore. Nevertheless, you’d start to crank up the emotion, and he would just sit there and maybe even look out the window or yawn. But even if he sat there just looking and listening, you still felt exposed to yourself. Even if you were with a group and it didn’t seem like you were being noticed, you felt all your awkwardness.</p>
<p class="calibre1">With a teacher you feel all the ways in which you</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p215"></a> <i class="calibre3">HighStakes Practice</i></p>
<p class="calibre1">197</p>
<p class="calibre1">try to con the situation, you feel all the ways in which you try to make yourself look good. You’re seeing clearly what you do all the time. But you’ve made this commitment—one you’re not going to run away from, you’re not going to write off. This time you’re going to stick with it. Staying there becomes like the three difficulties. When you’re with the spiritual friend or even thinking about him or her, you begin to see neurosis as neurosis. That encourages you to practice the second difficulty, which is to begin to apply the teachings. And finally, you long to make that a way of life. The spiritual friend does not con-firm your existence but serves as a mirror for you to see where you’re stuck. The relationship encourages you to wake up.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The most important thing about the relationship with the spiritual friend is that it’s basic training for how you relate to every situation in your life. It’s all training for you to be grateful to every Juan, and not just the Juan or Juanita that you call your spiritual friend. So when your buttons get pushed, you begin to see that what’s happening is your teacher. When your cover has been blown, you begin to see that situation as your teacher. You realize that you know what to do and can begin to relate directly with that pain and use it to relate with the pain of all sentient beings. When you feel inspired and joyful, you can share that with others and develop a sense of kinship.

<p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre3">HighStakes Practice</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre3">The teachings and practices</i>. The second principal cause is the teachings and practices. You have a lot of support when you see what you do rather than turn it against yourself or try to run away from it. You have a lot of encouragement from the teachings and practices to open your heart further, to feel what’s going on and not shut down, extending your openness to other sentient beings. When the mirror has just told you that you’re not the fairest of them all, and you’re feeling embarrassed and awkward, it begins to occur to you that there are many other people at this very moment feeling the same way. You can breathe it in for all of you. When you’re feeling happy, it begins to occur to you to think of others and wish for all beings to be happy.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre3">Precious human birth</i>. So the first principal cause is the teacher, who serves as an example and represents life itself, and who also serves as a pointed reminder to let go of holding on to yourself. The second is the teachings and the practices that actually give you tools for opening your heart. And the third cause is this precious human birth. All of us have this precious human birth. We’re fortunate enough not to be starving; we’re fortunate enough to have food and shelter; we’re fortunate enough to hear the teachings and be given methods to wake up; we’re fortunate enough to have good intelligence and the luxury to explore and question why we and others suffer.</p>

Another slogan says, “This time, practice the main points.” What that’s saying is that for all of us it’s a crucial time. We have everything we need to open our hearts, and to work with others in a genuine way.<p class="calibre1"></p>
<p class="calibre1">We have a precious human birth; we’re not starving in Somalia. We’re not living in a country where we grow up being taught to shoot anybody who’s on the other side. We have a tremendous amount going for us, so this is the crucial time to practice the main points.</p>
<p class="calibre1">In the slogan “Pay heed that the three never wane,”</p>
<p class="calibre1">the three are gratitude to your teacher, gratitude to the teachings and the practices, and a commitment to keep the basic vows that you’ve taken. Gratitude to the teacher starts with making a commitment never to give up on that one person, who has also made a commitment never to give up on you. When I think of my own teacher I feel enormous gratitude continually, practically every moment of my life. It’s gratitude that there was somebody who was brave enough and fierce enough and humorous enough and compassionate enough to get it through my thick skull that there’s no place to hide. I feel gratitude to the teachings and the practices because they’re good medicine and they help us to uncover that soft spot that’s been covered over for a very long time.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Finally, we pay heed that the refuge vow and bod-</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p218"></a>200</p>
<p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre3">HighStakes Practice</i></p>
<p class="calibre1">hisattva vows never wane. The refuge vow is a commitment not to seek islands of safety any longer but to learn how to leap, how to fly, how to leave the nest and go into uncharted territory, no longer hampered by tiny, self-centered views and opinions. The bodhisattva vow is highstakes practice because it’s about giving up privacy and the comfort orientation altogether as a way of awakening your heart further to yourself and to all sentient beings.</p>
<p class="calibre1">In general, we should pay heed that gratitude and appreciation for everything that happens to us never wane. Whether we consider what happens to us good fortune or ill fortune, appreciation for this life can wake us up and give us the courage we need to stay right there with whatever comes through the door.</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p219"></a>2 2</p>
<p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre3">Train Wholeheartedly</i></p>
<p class="calibre1">Now it’s time for us to continue our journey and “walk it like we talk it.” One of the final slogans is “Observe these two, even at the risk of your life.” It refers once again to the refuge and bodhisattva vows. It has a sense of urgency—”even at the risk of your life”—that’s telling us not to be afraid to leave the nest. Don’t be afraid of losing ground or of things falling apart or of not having it all together.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The meaning of observing the essence of the refuge vow even at the risk of your life is “no escape, no problem.” To observe the bodhisattva vow is to exchange ourselves for others and develop compassion for ourselves and others. So even at the risk of our own lives, if it’s painful, breathe it in and think about all of the other people who are experiencing pain. If it’s delightful, give it away and wish for all people to have that delight. That’s the essence of this slogan; it’s a revolutionary idea.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Here is one last story about exchanging self for others. I met a young man who had been on a spiritual journey most of his life. He was awake but smug.</p>
<p class="calibre1">He suffered from what’s called spiritual pride. He was complaining about his girlfriend, who was having 201</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p220"></a>202</p>
<p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre3">Train Wholeheartedly</i></p>
<p class="calibre1">a hard time giving up smoking; the anxiety was triggering an old eating disorder. The young man said he just kept telling her to be strong, not to be so fearful, to be disciplined. And she would tell him, “I’m trying.</p>
<p class="calibre1">I’m really trying. I’m doing the best I can.” He was angry because it didn’t seem to him that she was trying. He said, “I know I shouldn’t be getting so angry about this. I know I should be more compassionate.</p>
<p class="calibre1">But I just can’t help it. It gets under my skin. I want to be more understanding, but she’s so stuck.” Then he heard himself say, “I’m trying. I’m really trying. I’m doing the best I can.” When he heard himself saying <i class="calibre3">her </i> words, he got the message. He understood what she was up against, and it humbled him.</p>
<p class="calibre1">I think that all of us are like eagles who have forgotten that we know how to fly. The teachings are reminding us who we are and what we can do. They help us notice that we’re in a nest with a lot of old food and old diaries, excrement and stale air. From when we were very young we’ve had this longing to see those mountains in the distance and experience that big sky and the vast ocean, but somehow we got trapped in that nest, just because we forgot that we knew how to fly. We are like eagles, but we have on underwear and pants and shirt and socks and shoes and a hat and coat and boots and mittens and a Walkman and dark glasses, and it occurs to us that we could experience that vast sky, but we’d better start taking off some of this stuff. So we take off the</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p221"></a> <i class="calibre3">Train Wholeheartedly</i></p>
<p class="calibre1">203</p>
<p class="calibre1">coat and the hat and it’s cold, but we know that we have to do it, and we teeter on the edge of the nest and we take off. Then we find out for ourselves that everything has to go. You just can’t fly when you are wearing socks and shoes and coats and pants and underwear. Everything has to go.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Marpa the Translator was Milarepa’s teacher. He walked all the way from Tibet to India three times in order to get the teachings. Once when he was returning from India, he was with a companion whom he met every so often to compare who was getting the most teachings. His companion became jealous because he felt that Marpa was getting more. When they were in a boat in the middle of a turbulent river, his friend took all of the texts that Marpa had collected and threw them overboard. Talk about an opportunity for tonglen! Marpa didn’t exactly feel friendly toward this man. But he realized when he got back to Tibet that he had understood something about all of those teachings in all of those books. He really didn’t need it all written down. He had understood something; he had digested something. The teachings and himself had become one.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Each of us has also understood something, and that’s what we’ll take away from our study and practice of these teachings. These are things that are going to be part of our being now, part of the way that we see things and hear things and smell things.</p>
<p class="calibre1">We try so hard to hang on to the teachings and “get</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p222"></a>204</p>
<p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre3">Train Wholeheartedly</i></p>
<p class="calibre1">it,” but actually the truth sinks in like rain into very hard earth. The rain is very gentle, and we soften up slowly at our own speed. But when that happens, something has fundamentally changed in us. That hard earth has softened. It doesn’t seem to happen by trying to get it or capture it. It happens by letting go; it happens by relaxing your mind, and it happens by the aspiration and the longing to want to communicate with yourself and others. Each of us finds our own way.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The very last slogan is “Train wholeheartedly.” You could say, “Live wholeheartedly.” Let everything stop your mind and let everything open your heart. And you could say, “Die wholeheartedly, moment after moment.” Moment after moment, let yourself die wholeheartedly.</p>
<p class="calibre1">I have a friend who is extremely ill, in the final stages of cancer. The other night Dzongzar Khyentse Rinpoche telephoned her, and the very first words he said were, “Don’t even think for a moment that you’re not going to die.” That’s good advice for all of us; it will help us to live and train wholeheartedly.</p>
<p class="calibre1">These teachings are elusive, even though they seem so concrete: if it hurts, breathe in it; if it’s pleasant, send it out. It isn’t really something that you finally and completely “get.” We can read Trungpa Rinpoche’s commentaries on mind training and read the text by Jamgön Kongtrül. We can read them and</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p223"></a> <i class="calibre3">Train Wholeheartedly</i></p>
<p class="calibre1">205</p>
<p class="calibre1">try to apply them to our lives, and we can let them continually haunt us, haunt us into understanding what it really means to exchange oneself for others.</p>
<p class="calibre1">What does that really mean? And what does it mean to be a child of illusion? What does it mean to drive all blames into oneself or to be grateful to everyone?</p>
<p class="calibre1">What is bodhichitta, anyway? Trying to speak these teachings to you is—for me—a chance to digest them further. Now you are going to find yourself speaking them and living them and digesting them.</p>
<p class="calibre1">May you practice these teachings and take them to heart. May you make them your own and spread them to others.</p>
